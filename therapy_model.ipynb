The theory can guide the discovery\\nof the sources of each individual person’s emotional difficulties. Just as\\nimportant are the tools of CBT, derived from the theory, that practitioners\\nhave developed over the past 40 years. This great variety of techniques\\nallows therapists to tailor their interventions to the specific needs and\\npreferences of each patient. So how can the power of CBT, which would\\nseem to require a skilled therapist to help patients identify their unique\\npatterns and to select and adapt the right tools, be conveyed in book form?\\nEnter Dr. Seth Gillihan, who in clear and plain yet elegant language is able\\nto connect with any reader who wants to understand and address his or her\\nown barriers to good mental health.\\nThe soothing and confident voice behind this book is one I know very\\nwell. In 2005, Seth became the 50th PhD student at the University of\\nPennsylvania (Penn) whom I taught and supervised in a yearlong practical\\ncourse in CBT. Over the past 35 years I have been privileged to teach the\\nprinciples and practice of CBT to some of the most impressive and\\nmotivated young professionals one could hope to meet. Their level of talent\\nand knowledge, along with their commitment to learn, continues to amaze\\nme. But Seth left a lasting impression on me for his wisdom and ability to\\nconnect to individuals from all backgrounds and walks of life. He possesses\\nan unparalleled ability to convey the best of what I learned from my own\\nmentors, Drs. Steven Hollon and Aaron T. Beck, and he has added\\nextremely useful insights of his own.\\nI first encountered Seth's gift as a helping professional while watching\\nvideo recordings of his therapy sessions, reading his case notes, and hearing\\nhis crystal-clear descriptions of the successes—and hiccups—he and his\\nclients experienced as they worked together. I now see the same Seth\\nGillihan, with vastly more experience, who has “warmed up” to the current\\nproject by authoring Retrain Your Brain: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in 7Weeks, a fine workbook, and also coauthoring a practical and sensitive\\nguide for individuals and the families of those who suffer from obsessive-\\ncompulsive disorder.\\nHis newest book is a delightful read, which is no small accomplishment\\ngiven the seriousness of the subject matter and his honest, realistic\\ntreatment of the problems he addresses. The book manages to cover a lot of\\nground, in detail, and yet remain “simple,” as its title suggests. It draws\\neven further upon Seth’s strengths, including an unmatched ability to\\norganize and structure material, which makes it easy to grasp and retain the\\nmany nuggets found within its pages. Unique to this book is the rhythm that\\nSeth establishes at the outset and carries though each chapter, spelling out\\nhow to address unhelpful thinking, how to use behaviors to alter\\nproblematic patterns, and finally, how to attend to, and be mindful of, the\\nimportant things in our lives. I was so impressed by this rhythm that I now\\ninclude it in my own teaching: Think, Act, and Be. What could be simpler?\\nAnd yet the ideas these words reflect are rich and powerful enough to\\nproduce seismic positive shifts in the lives of clients in therapy. They can do\\nthe same for readers of this book.\\nEven if a reader does not have difficulties in all the areas covered in the\\nbook (sadness, worry, fear, anger, procrastination, self-criticism), I highly\\nrecommend the sections on three topics in particular: procrastination, anger,\\nand “safety behaviors.” The insights Seth provides about these often-\\npuzzling yet all-too-common patterns are really interesting! And if nothing\\nelse, his characterizations of these patterns can help the reader understand a\\nbit better how they trip up friends, colleagues, or family members.\\nMost of us procrastinate, yet we do not have insight into the sources of\\nor the processes behind procrastination. Anger, inappropriate or excessive\\nversions of which are all too common, can be understood. This is half the\\nbattle in getting anger under our control or in helping a partner who is in its\\ngrip. Finally, safety behaviors prevent those with unrealistic fears or\\ncompulsive behaviors from breaking free and enjoying what life has to\\noffer. Reading Seth’s analysis of these patterns is revelatory and engaging.\\nThis is a great example, well explained, of the progress made by\\npsychologists in our understanding of “what makes people tick.”Some readers will turn to this book to brush up on the principles and\\npractices of CBT they had encountered in personal therapy or in another\\nform. Others will learn about CBT for the first time and find all they need to\\nfree themselves from unnecessary and unproductive emotional distress and\\nbe set on a path to better living. This book can also serve as a much-needed\\nfirst step for those with more severe problems who have considered taking\\nantidepressant or antianxiety medications or who have tried them and not\\nfound them to be helpful, as well as for those who haven't been able to find\\na therapist they are ready to work with. Many such people will find\\neverything they need within these pages. There will also be others who will\\nbegin to learn about the sources and remedies for emotional difficulties that\\nhave held them back and kept them from enjoying life, and this will\\nmotivate them to seek appropriate professional guidance or help. They can\\ncarry what they have learned from Seth and from engaging in the exercises\\nin this book into individual or group therapy if that is the right next step.\\nLet me sum up by reflecting on how lucky I was to have had the\\nopportunity to contribute to Seth’s growth as a psychologist. It is now your\\nluck that you have encountered this truly helpful and (I'll say it again) really\\ninteresting guide to common emotional problems and effective ways to\\novercome them. I urge you to take advantage of this bit of luck and set\\nyourself on a path to better living.\\nRobert J. DeRubeis, PhD.\\nSamuel H. Preston T erm Professor in the Social Sciences and Professor of Psychology\\nSchool of Arts and Sciences\\nUniversity of PennsylvaniaIntroduction\\nAt some point, all of us will find ourselves in the tight grip of\\noverwhelming emotions. It might be a feeling of anxious dread, depression\\nthat drains the color from life, panic that strikes at the most inopportune\\ntimes, frequent and excessive anger, or other experiences that grip our\\nminds and hearts. When we’re knocked off balance emotionally, we need\\ntried and tested ways to regain our footing and find relief as quickly as\\npossible.\\nEarly in my clinical training, I learned that some types of treatment have\\na lot more evidence to back them up, especially cognitive behavioral\\ntherapy (CBT). My first therapy supervisor encouraged me to pursue\\nspecialized training in CBT, which led me to the University of\\nPennsylvania, a school with a rich history in cognitive and behavioral\\ntreatments. As I focused on treatment for depression during my doctoral\\ntraining, I saw how depression bends our thinking in harmful directions,\\nand how CBT can retrain our thoughts to serve us better. I also learned that\\nbuilding more rewarding activities into our lives could have powerful\\nantidepressant effects.\\nWhen I finished my PhD, I was excited to take a faculty position at the\\nuniversity’s Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety, which had\\ndeveloped many of the best treatments for anxiety. During my four years\\nthere, I received intensive experience in treating debilitating anxiety,\\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, and trauma. I saw hundreds of lives\\nchanged by treatment programs that helped people face their fears head-on.\\nWhile I was there I learned that focusing our attention on the present with\\nopenness and curiosity is a powerful way to break the grip of anxiety and\\ndepression. This mindfulness-based approach has gained sufficient research\\nsupport to warrant its status as the “third wave” of CBT, alongside cognitive\\nand behavioral techniques.\\nOver the past two decades as a student, researcher, therapist, and\\nsupervisor, two things have stood out to me about effective treatments.\\nNumber one, they’re simple: Do enjoyable activities. Think helpfulthoughts. Face your fears. Be present. Take care of yourself. None of these\\napproaches is shocking or complicated. I’ve strived to capture that\\nsimplicity in the chapters ahead. When we’re struggling, we typically don’t\\nhave the time, desire, or energy to wade through page after page of research\\nfindings or study a treatise on the esoteric nuances in the field. We need\\nstraightforward options we can use right away.\\nNumber two, they’re not easy. I’ve learned that despite the simplicity of\\nthese effective treatments, they still require work. It’s hard to do more of\\nwhat you love when you’re depressed and unmotivated, hard to face your\\nfears when you’re fighting back panic, hard to train an overactive mind to\\nrest in the moment. That’s where you’ll find the power in CBT—to provide\\nnot just a goal to work toward, but manageable techniques and a systematic\\nplan to get you there.\\nIn my previous book, Retrain Your Brain, I provided a structured seven-\\nweek plan to manage anxiety and depression in a workbook format. You’ll\\nfind this book is similar in its simplified approach as I present the most\\nessential parts of the treatments. But in contrast to Retrain Your Brain, this\\none is designed for those who don’t necessarily need to complete a whole\\nworkbook. Instead, this book offers a collection of quick and highly\\naccessible research-based techniques that can be used as needed to manage\\nvarious struggles.\\nI’ve designed this book to be useful for those who have never heard of\\nCBT, who are currently working with a therapist, or who have used CBT in\\nthe past and want a resource to return to for periodic refreshers. Whatever\\nyour prior knowledge of CBT, I hope you will come back to this book as\\noften as necessary. We all need reminders of what keeps us feeling our best.\\nI do mean all of us. I want to assure you that I’m not writing this book\\nfrom some ivory tower, safely surrounded by abstract theories. Like\\neveryone I’m engaged in the joys and struggles of being alive. I’m excited\\nto provide you with a guide that will truly make understanding CBT simple.\\nI hope this book is helpful to you so that nothing gets in the way of\\nliving a life you love.CHAPTER ONE\\nYour CBT Starter Guide\\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has emerged in recent decades as the\\nbest-tested approach for managing a wide range of psychological\\nconditions. In this chapter, we’ll explore what CBT is, how it was\\ndeveloped, and what makes it so effective. We’ll also consider how it can\\nhelp with specific issues like depression and anxiety.\\nCBT: The Beginnings\\nCognitive behavioral therapy is a solution-focused form of psychotherapy,\\ndesigned to reduce symptoms and boost well-being as quickly as possible.\\nAs the name suggests, CBT includes both a cognitive component, which\\nfocuses on changing problematic patterns of thinking, and a behavioral\\ncomponent, which helps develop actions that serve us well. These building\\nblocks of CBT were developed somewhat independently. Let’s look at each\\nof these approaches before reviewing how they were joined together.\\nBEHA VIORAL THERAPY\\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, psychoanalysis was the most\\ncommon form of talk therapy for psychological conditions. This approach\\nwas based on Sigmund Freud’s theory of the mind and often involved\\nmeeting regularly with a therapist for several years and exploring one’s\\nchildhood and upbringing.\\nWhile countless people benefited from psychoanalysis and similar\\ntreatments, other human behavior specialists began looking for ways to\\nprovide relief more quickly. They were inspired by recent discoveries about\\nhow animals (including humans) learn, and began to apply these principles\\nto treat conditions like anxiety and depression.\\nThese efforts led to the development of behavior therapy by individuals\\nlike psychiatrist Joseph Wolpe and psychologist Arnold Lazarus. Wolpe andothers found that straightforward changes in one’s behavior could bring\\nrelief. For example, people with phobias could conquer their fears by\\ngradually facing what scared them. Thanks to these developments, a person\\nno longer had to spend years on a couch excavating childhood events—a\\nfew sessions of targeted work could provide lasting relief.\\nCOGNITIVE THERAPY\\nNot long after the advent of the first behavioral therapies, other mental\\nhealth specialists proposed a different explanation for psychological\\nstruggles. Psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck and psychologist Albert Ellis both put\\nforward the idea that our thoughts have powerful effects on our feelings and\\nbehaviors. Accordingly, they posited that our misery arises from our\\nthoughts. For example, it was believed depression was driven by overly\\nnegative beliefs about oneself and the world (e.g., “I’m a failure”).\\nAccording to Beck and other developers of cognitive therapy, treatment\\nfirst needed to identify the offending thoughts and then work to replace\\nthem with ones that are more accurate and helpful. With practice, people\\ncould develop ways of thinking that promote positive feelings and\\nbehaviors.\\nCOMBINING BEHA VIORAL AND COGNITIVE THERAPIES\\nWhile behavioral and cognitive therapies were developed somewhat\\nindependently, in practice they are complementary. Indeed, it wasn’t long\\nafter their development that the two strands were integrated into CBT. Even\\nAaron T. Beck, the father of cognitive therapy, renamed his signature\\ntreatment approach “cognitive behavior therapy” in line with the inclusion\\nof behavioral techniques in what was formerly called cognitive therapy.\\nThis integration is good news for people in need of treatment and who can\\nnow receive a more complete treatment package.Combining these therapies also helps us see how our thoughts, feelings,\\nand behaviors fit together (see the preceding figure). For example, when\\nwe’re feeling highly anxious, we tend to have thoughts about danger, and\\nthose thoughts will increase our anxiety. These thoughts and feelings in turn\\nwill make us more likely to avoid what we fear, which will reinforce our\\nanxiety. Once we understand these connections, it’s easier to find ways to\\nfeel better.\\nA THIRD W AVE: MINDFULNESS-BASED THERAPY\\nIn the 1970s, Jon Kabat-Zinn, who was trained as a molecular biologist,\\nbegan testing a new program called mindfulness-based stress reduction\\n(MBSR), based in practices that have been around for thousands of years.\\nMindfulness is grounded in the idea that we can relieve suffering by\\nfocusing our attention on our experiences in the present moment, as\\nopposed to ruminating on the past or worrying about the future. Mindful\\nawareness also includes a deliberate openness to our reality.\\nKabat-Zinn and his colleagues found that MBSR was very effective at\\nreducing distress among people with chronic pain. Since that time,\\nmindfulness-based treatments have been developed and tested for\\nconditions like depression, insomnia, and anxiety.\\nJust as cognitive and behavioral therapies were joined together,\\nmindfulness-based therapy has been integrated into some CBT programs.\\nFor instance, psychologist Zindel Segal and his colleagues found that\\nintegrating mindfulness training into cognitive therapy reduced depressionrelapse once therapy was over. Mindfulness-based treatments are part of\\nwhat is now called the “third wave” of CBT, having garnered a large\\namount of support from clinical trials, which is why I’ve included\\nmindfulness techniques throughout this book.\\nCBT Principles\\nBefore you begin your CBT journey, let’s take a look at some of its core\\nprinciples. These will help guide you along the path to effective practice.\\nCBT emphasizes collaboration and active participation. CBT works best\\nwhen you take an active role in defining treatment goals and deciding how\\nto move toward them. The therapy practice, guided by either a therapist or a\\nresource like this one, brings expertise about general principles and\\ntechniques, but it takes collaboration to tailor those components to your\\nspecific needs.\\nCBT is goal oriented and zeroes in on specific problems. A crucial part\\nof the work in CBT is defining the problem, which then makes that problem\\nfeel more manageable. Defining clear goals that are important to you is a\\nclosely related step in the treatment. These goals will focus your energy and\\nfuel your efforts as we work toward them.\\nCBT is rooted in the here and now. While some therapies concentrate\\nprimarily on childhood events, CBT focuses on how one’s thoughts and\\nactions in the present may be a part of ongoing struggles and how changing\\nthose patterns might be helpful. Though CBT does consider important\\nlearning experiences from early in life, its emphasis on the present makes it\\nan empowering treatment, focusing on factors that are within our control.\\nCBT aims to teach you how to be your own therapist. With CBT, you’ll\\nlearn a few basic skills to help you manage the issues that brought you to\\ntherapy. By practicing, you can apply these techniques on your own, even\\nwith new challenges that arise. CBT is a “teach a person to fish” kind of\\ntreatment that stays with you once therapy is over.CBT emphasizes relapse prevention. Learning how to stay well is an\\nintegral part of CBT. By understanding the factors that contributed to your\\nanxiety, depression, or other issues, we can be on the lookout for warning\\nsigns of a relapse. For example, a woman who recovered from depression\\ncan be aware of a tendency to withdraw from activities that keep her feeling\\nwell. These factors are why the relapse rates for depression and anxiety are\\nlower for CBT than for medication. It is critical that a person continues to\\npractice the new habits from CBT, just like someone who learned to play a\\nmusical instrument would need to keep practicing and playing to stay sharp.\\nCBT is time-limited. CBT fulfills its goal of offering relief in a relatively\\nshort period of time. For example, a typical treatment program for\\ndepression is about 16 sessions; phobias like fear of dogs can be treated\\neffectively in a single session of two to four hours. Shorter treatment\\nprograms can also be motivating, providing a sense of urgency to the work.\\nCBT is structured. Treatment elements in CBT are presented in a\\npredictable order, with later sessions building on earlier ones. Each session\\nfollows a consistent routine, too, starting with a review of how practice\\nwent between sessions, covering the day’s material, and, finally, planning\\nfor how to apply that material in one’s life in the coming days. This\\norganized approach is a big part of what makes CBT an efficient form of\\ntherapy.\\nCBT helps you address negative automatic thoughts. At the heart of\\nCBT is the recognition that our thoughts often lead us astray. We are prone\\nto negative automatic thoughts, which, as the name suggests, happen\\nspontaneously. CBT helps you learn to identify and respond to these\\nnegative automatic thoughts. For example, a man passed over for a\\npromotion might have the negative automatic thought, “I can never catch a\\nbreak.” In CBT, we first learn to recognize what our minds are telling us,\\nsince negative automatic thoughts can happen outside our conscious\\nawareness. Then we test the thoughts for accuracy. With practice, we can\\ndevelop more helpful ways of thinking.\\nCBT involves a variety of techniques. An impressive array of techniques\\nfalls under the CBT heading, from relaxation training to cognitiverestructuring to behavioral activation, exposure, and meditation. Part of the\\nwork of CBT is figuring out which techniques are most helpful for a\\nspecific person. You’ll encounter many of these tools in the chapters ahead\\nand will discover which of them will provide you with the most benefit.\\nI like to organize the techniques of CBT under the headings “Think”\\n(cognitive), “Act” (behavioral), and “Be” (mindfulness). I’ll refer to these\\nlabels at times throughout this book.\\nHow and Why CBT Works\\nMost of the principles and practices of CBT probably won’t surprise you.\\nFor example, facing our fears to overcome them is hardly a novel idea.\\nThose I’ve treated in my practice are sometimes skeptical that simple\\ntechniques like planning specific activities and minding our thoughts can\\nreally be helpful. If it were that simple, they reason, they would have gotten\\nbetter already. As we’ll see, CBT is not just about what we do, but also\\nabout how we do it. Let’s consider aspects of the CBT approach that make\\nit so beneficial.\\nBREAKING IT DOWN\\nCBT breaks down big challenges into smaller, more manageable pieces. An\\noverwhelming feeling of depression, for example, can be broken down into\\na collection of more manageable thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We can\\nthen match specific techniques to each component, such as cognitive\\nrestructuring to address depressed thinking. CBT also breaks down\\ninsurmountable tasks into a series of doable steps.\\nSTRUCTURED TRAINING\\nKnowing what we need to do to feel better is helpful but gets us only so far.\\nThe systematic and structured training of CBT ensures we get an adequate\\n“dose” of the techniques that can bring relief. For example, we might be\\naware that our angry thoughts are biased, but when we actually write downthe thoughts we’re having, we’re in a better position to examine them\\ncarefully and replace them as needed.\\nREPEA TED PRACTICE\\nMost of the work in CBT happens outside the therapy office or after the\\nreading we do about CBT. It’s not easy to build new habits, especially when\\nwe’re extremely well practiced in doing things that aren’t working for us. It\\ntakes repetition to reprogram our automatic responses to difficult situations.\\nCLINICAL SCIENCE\\nFrom the start, CBT has been about evidence and outcomes. Does it work?\\nHow effective is it? Because the treatment sessions are clearly laid out, CBT\\nprograms can be standardized and tested against control groups. Based on\\nthese clinical trials, we can have an idea of the average effect a certain\\nnumber of sessions will have on a particular condition. Recent studies have\\nextended these findings to confirm that CBT can be effective even without a\\ntherapist.\\nAttention! If you are suffering from severe depression, having serious\\nthoughts of hurting yourself, or experiencing other major mental health\\nissues, put down this book and contact a psychologist, psychiatrist, or other\\nhealth professional. If you’re experiencing a psychiatric or medical\\nemergency, call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room. The National\\nSuicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached anytime at 1-800-273-8255.\\nCOMMON PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS\\nThe most commonly prescribed medications for depression and anxiety\\nare selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines.\\nSSRIs are typically called “antidepressants,” but they can treat anxiety\\nabout as well as they treat depression. At high doses they can also treat\\nobsessive-compulsive disorder. Examples include fluoxetine (Prozac),\\nfluvoxamine (Luvox), and sertraline (Zoloft).Benzodiazepines work quickly to calm the nervous system, acting on\\nthe same receptors in the brain as alcohol and barbiturates. Commonly\\nprescribed benzodiazepines include alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam\\n(Ativan), and clonazepam (Klonopin). In addition to anxiety, they are\\nused to treat insomnia and agitation.\\nThese medications can be as effective as CBT, but relapse tends to be\\nmore common if the person stops taking them. Many people benefit\\nfrom a combination of CBT and psychiatric medication.\\nCommon side effects of SSRIs include nausea or vomiting, weight gain,\\ndiarrhea, sleepiness, or sexual problems; benzodiazepine use can lead to\\nnausea, blurred vision, headache, confusion, tiredness, nightmares, or\\nmemory impairment, among other possibilities. Prescribing doctors will\\ntake into account the potential benefits of an SSRI or benzodiazepine\\nversus the common side effects.\\nThis book focuses on CBT rather than medication. Check with your\\nprimary care doctor or a psychiatrist if you’re interested in a medication\\nconsultation.\\nHow Can You Help Yourself?\\nFor CBT to work best, it’s necessary to zero in on your particular needs.\\nAre you struggling with low mood, an uncontrolled temper, pervasive\\nworry, or something else? Let’s consider how CBT can be used to address\\ndifferent conditions and allow you to help yourself through the particular\\nissues that you are facing.\\nDEPRESSION\\nThoughts, feelings, and behaviors work together in a downward spiral when\\nwe’re depressed. Low mood and poor motivation make it hard to find\\npleasure even in things we used to enjoy. We see the world and ourselves in\\na negative light. As our thoughts and mood darken, we’re likely to pull back\\nfrom many of our activities, further deepening our depression.CBT can help us break the habit of negative thinking, which can make it\\neasier to get more active. In turn, greater engagement with life lifts our\\nmood and boosts our view of ourselves. If we practice mindfulness, we can\\nfurther improve our mood as we learn to take our thoughts less seriously.\\nTaken together, these practices can create a “virtuous circle” of mutually\\nreinforcing improvements in our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\\nANXIETY\\nWhen we care about an outcome that’s uncertain, the situation is likely to\\ncause us some anxiety. For example, we might be nervous about a first date\\nor about getting to a job interview on time. Low to moderate levels of\\nanxiety are perfectly normal. In fact, anxiety is useful, because being\\nslightly anxious heightens our attention, increases our motivation, and\\nprovides us with energy to perform well. Beyond a certain point, though,\\nanxiety becomes counterproductive. For example, excessive social anxiety\\ncan interfere with our ability to think on our feet or be present with the\\nperson we’re talking to.\\nCBT offers many tools for managing anxiety. Techniques like\\nprogressive muscle relaxation and meditation can directly calm an agitated\\nnervous system. Cognitive techniques can address the exaggerated feeling\\nof danger that goes along with anxiety; for example, the belief that others\\nwill judge a person harshly if she blushes in class (in the case of social\\nanxiety). Exposure is also a powerful tool to combat anxiety as we face the\\nsituations we fear. With repeated practice, the situations become less scary\\nand anxiety provoking.\\nPANIC\\nIf you’ve had even one panic attack, you know how awful this type of\\nanxiety feels. Panic is like a fire alarm in your body and brain, sounding the\\ncall that something very bad is about to happen. Because there’s usually no\\nobvious threat—no lion chasing us, no oncoming car swerving into our lane\\n—the mind tends to detect an internal threat. I must be having a heart\\nattack or I’m going crazy. Sometimes you feel like you are about to passout. Most people with panic disorder will start to fear places where panic is\\nmore likely to occur, especially situations that would be hard to escape\\nfrom, like driving on a bridge or sitting in a movie theater.\\nEffective CBT for panic includes learning to control one’s breath when\\neverything else feels out of control; testing out the panic-related thoughts,\\nlike “I’m going to pass out,” which often heighten the feeling of danger;\\nand practicing being in progressively more challenging situations so they\\nstart to feel more comfortable. With repetition, these techniques can make\\npanic less likely even in situations that used to trigger it. We can also\\ndevelop a different relationship with our feelings of panic, beginning to see\\nit as no more or less than extreme anxiety, which by itself is not dangerous.\\nWORR Y\\nIf panic is the fire alarm of anxiety, worry is the dripping faucet. Whereas\\npanic strikes all at once, worry slowly grinds away at our sense of peace.\\nWhen we’re prone to worrying, it often doesn’t matter what we’re facing.\\nAny event can lead to worry, from the important to the trivial. The\\nfundamental question in chronic worry is, “What if . . .?” Frequent worry is\\noften accompanied by muscle tension, irritability, trouble sleeping, and\\nrestless agitation. Worry is the core feature of generalized anxiety disorder.\\nCBT offers several ways to combat excessive worry and tension. We\\ncan train ourselves to recognize when we’re worrying, which often escapes\\nour awareness. Once we know what the mind is up to, we have more of a\\nsay in whether we keep worrying. We can also address some of the beliefs\\nwe may have about worry, like that it helps us plan for the future. CBT also\\noffers many ways to “get out of our heads,” both through greater\\nengagement in activities and through mindful awareness of our experience.\\nBeing grounded in the present releases the mind from its anxious\\npreoccupation with the future. Finally, techniques like relaxation training\\nand meditation can lower the physical tension that often goes along with\\nconstant worry.\\nSTRESSWhen life’s challenges demand a response from us, we can feel a sense of\\npressure caused by stress. It could be from a family illness, a work deadline,\\nconflict with another person, or any other difficulty we have to face. As\\nwith anxiety, a certain amount of stress is helpful, like when a tennis player\\nfaces a challenging championship match and rises to the occasion.\\nStress provokes a full-body response, as stress hormones like cortisol\\nand adrenaline flood our system and set off a wide range of reactions. Acute\\nstress activates the sympathetic nervous system, preparing our bodies to\\nrespond to a threat by fighting, fleeing, or, sometimes, freezing. Our bodies\\nand minds are well equipped to handle brief spikes in stress. However,\\nwhen the stressors are chronic—like a traffic-filled two-hour commute five\\ndays a week, an abusive work environment, or a protracted and contentious\\ndivorce—our coping resources get depleted. We may start to get sick more\\noften, become depressed, or show other mental and physical signs of being\\noverwhelmed.\\nCBT offers tools for calming the nervous system, like specific breathing\\ntechniques that dial down our fight-or-flight system. We can also address\\nways of thinking that amplify stress, such as seeing challenges at work as\\nopportunities to fail rather than to succeed. CBT can encourage us to take\\nour self-care more seriously, as well, to increase our ability to process\\nfrequent stress.\\nANGER\\nAs with anxiety and stress, anger can be very useful. Anger energizes us to\\nright a wrong, like dealing with injustice. Our anger becomes a problem\\nwhen we experience it so much that it starts to damage our health and our\\nrelationships. Oftentimes our anger arises from beliefs that may or may not\\nbe true. For example, was that driver trying to stick it to me when he cut me\\noff or did he simply misjudge the distance between our cars? My belief\\nabout his intention will affect my emotional response and whether I\\nretaliate.\\nCBT offers ways to fix thoughts that drive excessive anger. It can also\\nhelp find ways to structure your life to reduce anger, like starting your\\nmorning commute 15 minutes earlier so you’re less stressed and impatientbehind the wheel. CBT can also help us find ways to express anger\\nconstructively rather than destructively.\\nIn the coming chapters, we’ll dig into strategies that will help you\\nharness the power of CBT, starting with choosing effective goals in chapter\\n2.\\nMOOD DISORDERS BY THE NUMBERS\\nIf you’re overwhelmed with anxiety, depression, anger, or other\\nemotions, you’re certainly not alone. Among adults in the United States:\\n•Nearly 29 percent will have an anxiety disorder at some point in their\\nlife, including phobias (12 percent), social anxiety disorder (12\\npercent), generalized anxiety disorder (6 percent), and panic disorder\\n(5 percent).\\n•As many as 25 percent will experience major depressive disorder\\nduring their lifetime.\\n•In a given year, more than 44 million will experience an anxiety\\ndisorder and more than 16 million will experience major depressive\\ndisorder.\\n•Women are 70 percent more likely than men to experience depression\\nand anxiety.\\n•About 8 percent experience anger so intense it leads to significant\\nproblems, with slightly higher rates for men than for women.\\nGetting the Most out of This Book\\nI’ve designed this book so you can use as much or as little of it as you need\\nto address your particular issues. Feel free to jump from chapter to chapter\\nto find the set of techniques that works best for you. However, I do\\nrecommend that you continue reading through chapter 2, which focuses on\\ngoal setting.\\nI suggest you focus on a small number of techniques as you begin—\\nprobably no more than one or two per week. For example, if you’re dealingwith depression, it is enough for one week to start getting more active.\\nThere will be time in the following weeks to address your thought\\nprocesses, optimize self-care, develop a mindfulness practice, and so forth.\\nWhen you do find what applies to you in this book, I encourage you to\\nspend some time with the material and try to internalize the concepts by\\ndoing the recommended exercises to reinforce your learning. It’s one thing\\nto know what we need to do to feel better and quite another to do it. CBT is\\nabout action, and that’s where you’ll find the real benefit.\\nAbove all, remember that your well-being is worth the investment of\\ntime and energy. The work you do now can pay dividends for years to\\ncome.\\nChapter Summary and Homework\\nIn this chapter, we reviewed the origins of CBT, how it was developed, and\\nwhat makes it effective in treating depression, anxiety, panic, worry, stress,\\nand anger. The main takeaway is that CBT works by offering structured\\nways to practice simple and powerful techniques, which is precisely what\\nthis book is meant to do.\\nSpeaking of practice, I’ll be inviting you at the end of each chapter to do\\nsome homework. Don’t let the word “homework” scare you, though. CBT\\nhomework consists of things you actually want to practice so you can feel\\nbetter. You’re in the driver’s seat.\\nFor this week, consider the following questions:\\n•What is the number one issue you hope this book will help you with?\\n•What have you tried so far to get some relief?\\n•What has worked well and what hasn’t?\\n•How does CBT as I’ve described it compare with what you’ve tried in\\nthe past?\\n•Finally, how are you feeling after reading the first chapter?\\nFor subsequent chapters, you’ll need a journal that’s dedicated to your\\nCBT work. If you don’t have one already, plan to get one before you startchapter 2.\\nWhen you’re ready, we’ll discuss goal setting in the next chapter.CHAPTER TWO\\nGoal Setting\\nAs we saw in the previous chapter, CBT can be helpful for all kinds of\\nconditions. However, before we dive into the application of CBT for\\nspecific issues, we need to decide what we want to change. In this chapter,\\nwe’ll focus on figuring out the goals you want to work toward. Here is an\\nexample of a patient and how we worked together to establish the best way\\nto address his needs.\\nIn my first session with Jeff, he told me about the major depression and\\nsleep problems that came on the heels of a long and serious health\\nbattle. I learned about Jeff’s most important relationships, his family of\\norigin, work history, and other aspects of his life. He was also able to\\nidentify a few of his strengths, though he spoke of them in the past tense,\\nalmost as if he were talking about someone else.\\nOnce I had a good picture of Jeff’s situation, I needed to know what he\\nhoped to get out of therapy. Like everyone else, he wanted to feel better\\n—but what would that look like for him? How would his life be\\ndifferent? What did he want to do more and less of? How would the\\nquality of his relationships improve? In short: what were his goals?\\nBy the end of our first session, Jeff seemed more hopeful. I asked how he\\nwas feeling and he said he actually felt a little excited—even inspired—\\nfor the first time in as long as he could remember.\\nBy setting goals he had transformed dissatisfaction with his situation\\ninto determination to improve it.\\nLet’s consider what was so helpful for Jeff about identifying his goals\\nand how you can develop goals that will inspire your efforts.\\nThe Benefits of Compelling GoalsIt’s hard to overstate the value of having good goals. When we have a clear\\nvision of where we want to go, it’s much easier to commit to the changes\\nwe’ll need to make to get there. It’s a lot like climbing a mountain: When\\nyou know where the summit is, you’re motivated to keep climbing till you\\nreach it.\\nGoals also help us stay the course when we run into challenges along\\nthe way and compel us to find ways to reach our target. For example, Jeff\\nhad been avoiding starting to exercise again because he wasn’t sure what he\\ncould do given his recent health problems. Once he committed to the goal\\nof exercising three times a week, he started figuring out a program that\\nwould work for him. Goals also provide a basis of comparison for how\\ntreatment is progressing. Jeff and I often returned to his goals throughout\\ntreatment to assess whether we were helping him move toward them.\\nGoals That Set Us Up for Success\\nNot all goals are created equal. As you are thinking about your life and the\\nways anxiety and depression may be affecting things, I recommend keeping\\nthese principles in mind as you set your own goals:\\nBE SPECIFIC\\nIt’s hard to tell when you’ve reached a vague goal like be more involved\\nwith my kids, whereas read at least one book per day to my two-year-old is\\nspecific and easy to measure. You should be able to tell when you’ve met\\nyour goals, so be sure to make them as objective as possible.\\nFIND THE “RIGHT GEAR”\\nIf you make goals too hard you’ll feel discouraged, like trying to pedal a\\nbike up a mountain in a gear that’s too high, but goals that are too easy are\\nuninspiring, like coasting along in a gear that’s too low. Aim for the sweet\\nspot: moderately challenging goals you can reach with sustained effort.\\nCHOOSE GOALS YOU CARE A BOUTWe’ll have little chance of meeting our goals if they aren’t important to us.\\nFor each goal, think about why it matters to you and how reaching it will\\nimprove your life. Along these lines, make sure the goals are actually yours\\nand not just what someone else wants you to do.\\nBE REALISTIC\\nWhen we’ve been suffering for a long time, it’s understandable that we\\nwant to get better as quickly as possible. We might be tempted to try to\\ndo everything at once, and set overly ambitious goals for ourselves. If\\nour goals are unrealistic, we set ourselves up for feeling like a failure\\nwhen we don’t reach them. We may start out strong and then fade\\nquickly as we exhaust our already depleted reserves.\\nAs you’re setting goals for yourself, aim to balance discipline and\\ncompassion, holding yourself to a standard while also being kind to\\nyourself. Sometimes we set goals based on what we’re able to do for a\\nday or a week, without really considering what it will take to sustain\\nthat level of activity. For example, we might resolve to exercise for an\\nhour, seven days a week, and pull it off for the first few days. But\\neventually, we won’t have the time, energy, or motivation to work out\\none day. Once the streak is broken, we may be less likely to resume\\nexercising at all.\\nPart of being compassionate with ourselves is being patient as our\\nrecovery unfolds. While it’s a worthwhile and inspiring goal to reclaim\\nthe life we once had, it’s probably unrealistic to think we can get there\\nimmediately. Physical therapy is a good metaphor for emotional and\\nmental healing: the right amount of stretching and strengthening may\\nleave us a bit sore for a day, but not so much that we’re reinjured or\\nhave to stop doing our exercises. So while you’re setting your goals,\\nkeep in mind that life is a marathon, not a sprint.\\nGetting from Here to ThereThe first step toward determining your goals is to understand and accept\\nwhat you want to change about yourself and your situation. This process\\nrequires openness and honesty to willingly face your own limitations.\\nBut first, let’s identify your strengths. No matter how much we may be\\nstruggling in some areas, we have strengths that keep us going. I often find\\nthat the very act of seeking help—whether in person or from a book like\\nthis—reflects an inner strength and a refusal to settle for second best. What\\ndo you bring to the world? What are your best features or abilities? What do\\nyour family members and close friends love about you? Feel free to ask\\nsomeone who loves you what they consider to be your strengths. Keep these\\npositive qualities in mind as you’re developing your goals. In the sections\\nthat follow, you’ll be considering how things are going in six important life\\ndomains. If you have goals related to one of these areas, write them down\\non a separate piece of paper or in your journal.\\nRELA TIONSHIPS\\nAs a general rule, nothing has a bigger impact on our well-being than our\\nclosest relationships. Nothing can really compensate for impoverished\\nconnections with others, and we can tolerate just about anything if our\\nrelationships are strong and supportive.\\nIf you’re in an intimate relationship, consider your relationship with\\nyour partner first. If you’re currently single and have goals related to\\nfinding a partner, like starting to date again, include those goals in your list\\nand return to this list upon developing an intimate relationship.\\n•What is going well for you and your partner?\\n•Where do you struggle?\\n•Do you and your significant other meet each other’s needs?\\n•How is your communication—do you avoid outward conflict at all costs,\\nor is your fighting out of control?\\n•Are you satisfied with the frequency and quality of your sexual\\nintimacy?\\n•Do you have enough time together to nourish your connection?Now think about your other important relationships, including with your\\nchildren, parents, and friends. Take stock of each connection, and determine\\nanything you’d like to change about the relationship—especially in ways\\nyou can control. For example, I want my partner to be more loving is less in\\nyour control than I will communicate my needs to my partner.\\nAs you construct your relationship goals, it may help to consider how\\nyour personal struggles with anxiety, anger, or other issues have affected the\\nquality of your connections with others. For example, if depression has led\\nyou to interact less with the people close to you, consider setting goals to\\nspend more time with them.\\nFAITH/MEANING\\nThe good life is a meaningful life—one in which we feel connected to our\\npassions and what we value most. Many of us find meaning through our\\nconnections to family. We might also be part of a faith community and feel\\ninspired by sacred texts and a sense of connection to a higher power. Or we\\nmay find an expansive feeling of awareness and connection through natural\\nbeauty by walking in the woods or in practices like meditation. Whatever\\nthe specifics, we tend to find meaning and purpose by connecting to\\nsomething bigger than ourselves. Think about your own passions:\\n•What’s most important to you in life?\\n•Do your actions seem purposeful, tied to what you really care about?\\n•Or do you crave connection to something that really matters?\\nAn exercise that can be helpful is to consider what you’d like the people\\nwho know you best to say about you ten years from now. Are there phrases\\nor qualities that come to mind? When Jeff thought about this, he said he\\nwanted people to describe the love he showed to those close to him and the\\ngusto he brought to life—qualities he was having a hard time expressing in\\nthe midst of his depression. What would you like your loved ones to say\\nabout you? Your answer can help shape your goals in this area.\\nEDUCA TION AND WORKWork can be a means to satisfy our basic psychological needs. Through\\nwork we can feel like we’re competent at what we do, whether we’re\\nstudents, employees, or stay-at-home parents. We can also satisfy our need\\nfor autonomy through our work if we have some control over what we do\\nand how we do it. Our need for connection to others is also affected by the\\nquality of our relationships at work. How have things been for you at work?\\n•Do you like what you do, maybe even finding a sense of meaning in\\nyour job?\\n•Has anxiety, depression, or another difficulty made it harder to do your\\njob or interfered with your performance?\\n•Does your work feel appropriately challenging—not so easy you’re\\ncoasting along feeling bored, and not so hard that you’re overwhelmed\\nby the demands?\\nTake a moment to write down what you’ve noticed about your recent\\nrelationship to your work.\\nPHYSICAL HEAL TH\\nThere is increasing awareness that the body and mind are intimately\\nconnected, with each affecting the other. A psychological state like anxiety\\ncan trigger a host of physical reactions (e.g., muscle tension, headache,\\ngastrointestinal distress) and physical states like having low blood sugar can\\npowerfully affect our thoughts and emotions. Let’s consider some of the\\nmajor facets of physical health and goals you may have for any of these\\nareas.\\nGeneral\\nYou can start thinking about your physical health by focusing on how you\\ngenerally feel.\\n•How is your overall health?\\n•Do you have to manage any major health issues?\\n•Are there any doctor’s appointments you’ve been putting off?•Have health problems interfered with your life in any way?\\n•In general, does your health seem to be improving, getting worse, or\\nstaying the same?\\nMovement\\nRegular physical activity is good for just about everything. Exercise doesn’t\\nhave to mean sweating in a gym—any form of movement counts, and the\\nmore enjoyable the better.\\n•Do you get some form of exercise at least a few times a week?\\n•How does your body feel when you use it—any nagging aches and pains\\nor loss of mobility?\\n•How does your mood affect your level of activity, and vice versa?\\nDrugs, Alcohol, or Tobacco\\nSubstances that affect our nervous system influence our emotional state, and\\nour emotions often affect our use of these chemicals.\\nFor example, we might use marijuana or consume more alcohol to cope\\nwith work-related stress.\\n•If you use recreational drugs, alcohol, or tobacco, how would you\\ndescribe your relationship with these substances?\\n•Do you often use them to deal with difficult emotions?\\n•Has your use led to any problems, or does it seem manageable?\\n•Has anyone tried to get you to cut back or quit?\\n•Are there any changes you want to make in your pattern of use?\\nIf drug use or alcohol consumption is having a major effect on your life,\\ntalk with your doctor about where to find professional help. See also the\\nResources section at the end of this book.\\nNutritionThe food we put in our bodies can have a big impact on how we feel. These\\ndays everyone seems to have their favorite diet—paleo, gluten-free,\\nWhole30, ketogenic, Mediterranean, or South Beach, to name just a few.\\nOne thing these diets agree on is that we do our bodies and minds a favor\\nwhen we eat whole, unprocessed foods, including plenty of vegetables and\\nfruits. We won’t feel our best if we eat a lot of sugar, refined carbohydrates,\\nand other highly processed foods.\\n•Are you satisfied with the kinds of foods you typically eat?\\n•Has a doctor, nutritionist, or loved one suggested you make any\\nchanges?\\n•Are there changes you’ve been meaning to make in your nutritional\\nhabits?\\nSleep\\nSleep and emotional health often go hand in hand. Solid, restorative sleep\\nenergizes our minds and bodies, while poor sleep does the opposite.\\n•How would you describe your sleep in general?\\n•Do you get adequate rest each night, or do you often stay up too late and\\nthen rely on caffeine to get you through the day?\\n•Is there anything that routinely disrupts your sleep, like pets or young\\nchildren?\\n•Are you experiencing chronic difficulty falling asleep or sleeping\\nsoundly?\\n•What, if anything, would you like to change about your sleep?\\nRESPONSIBILITIES A T HOME\\nEach of us has things to take care of at home, like doing the dishes or\\nmowing the lawn. Think about your domestic tasks.\\n•Have you fallen behind on anything?\\n•Are there projects you’ve been meaning to get to and keep putting off?•Is anything getting in the way of taking care of things?\\nRECREA TION AND LEISURE\\nLife isn’t just about taking care of our responsibilities. We need downtime\\nto recharge and enjoy the fruits of our labors.\\n•What are some of your favorite things to do in your free time?\\n•Do your job and home responsibilities leave you with barely any time to\\nrelax?\\n•Have your mood-related struggles gotten in the way of activities you\\nenjoy?\\nMake sure you’ve added to your list any goals for the areas discussed here.\\nLet’s look at Jeff’s completed goal list as an example. Notice that some\\ngoals, like for exercise, were more specific than others, like finding a better\\njob.\\nJeff’s completed goal list looked like this:\\n1Get together with friends once a week.\\n2Get seven to eight hours of sleep per night.\\n3Exercise four times per week for at least 30 minutes.\\n4Find a job I’m more excited about.\\n5Get back to woodworking regularly.\\nDon’t hesitate to include goals on your own list that will require\\nadditional clarification down the road, like improve my diet. It’s better to\\nhave a general placeholder for now than to leave off a goal that’s important\\nto you.\\nIt’s Not You, It’s Your Limbic System\\nResearch over the past few decades has helped us understand the role of the\\nbrain in producing our emotions. Scientists have identified a key group of\\nbrain structures called the limbic system that underlies emotional\\nexperience. The limbic system includes areas like the hippocampus,amygdala, cingulate gyrus, olfactory bulb (involved in the sense of smell),\\nthalamus, and hypothalamus.\\nCourtesy OpenStax College, Anatomy and Physiology (CC)\\nThe limbic system plays a key role in activating the body’s stress\\nresponse through the hypothalamus, which controls our hormone system.\\nThanks to our limbic system, we can feel strong emotions, avoid danger,\\nform new memories, experience pleasure, and many other essential\\nfunctions.\\nThe limbic system and parts of the prefrontal cortex are believed to have\\ncomplementary roles, with limbic regions generating emotions and the\\nprefrontal cortex regulating those emotions. For example, activity in the\\namygdala increases when we’re frightened, whereas activity in the\\nprefrontal cortex increases when we try to control our emotions.\\nAt times the limbic system can be out of balance. For example, many\\npsychiatric conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major\\ndepressive disorder have been linked to overactivity in the amygdala.\\nIt’s easy to blame ourselves for our emotional struggles. After all, it’s\\nour feelings and our behavior that are affected. At the same time, we oftenoverestimate the control we have over our brain function. When we’ve gone\\nthrough a major trauma, for example, we’ll likely experience a change in\\nour hippocampus that has nothing to do with our will or our strength of\\ncharacter.\\nMany factors outside our control can affect our brains and emotions. For\\nexample, my colleagues and I at the University of Pennsylvania found that\\nbrain activity varied based on genetic differences, current mood, changes in\\nthe weather—even poverty, as psychologist Martha Farah’s research has\\nshown. Sometimes we’re at the mercy of the way our nervous system reacts\\nwhen provoked.\\nAnd yet we’re not merely passive recipients of our brain states. Just as\\nexperiences outside our control can shape our brains, we can also reshape\\nthem based on how we choose to think and act. For example, we can quite\\nliterally change the structure of our brains through regular meditation\\npractice. We can also quiet an overactive limbic system and increase\\nactivity in key prefrontal cortex regions through certain kinds of therapy.\\nSo there is good news—while we can’t choose the brain we’re born\\nwith or control everything that happens to us, we can use our brains to fix\\nour brains. As you do your CBT work, keep in mind that you are changing\\nyour brain.\\nChapter Summary and Homework\\nThis chapter focused on setting your goals—what are you working toward\\nwith CBT? We reviewed the major life domains, giving you a chance to\\nconsider what’s going well (including your strengths) and where you’d like\\nto see some improvements. These areas included basic life functions like\\neating and sleeping, as well as higher-order factors like faith and meaning.\\nAlthough we went through each area separately, these domains affect each\\nother—for example, getting more sleep can improve our relationships. It\\nshould be clear from this chapter that wellness is many faceted, and we\\nneed to think holistically about ways to support our best selves.\\n1Take a few moments to review what you learned from this chapter. Did\\nyou discover anything about yourself and what’s important to you?2Be sure to write down your goals to make them more salient and easy to\\nremember.\\n3Think carefully about the goals you set. Are they inspiring? Specific\\nenough? About the right level of difficulty?\\n4I recommend keeping your goals somewhere visible and reviewing them\\nseveral times over the coming days.\\n5Also consider talking about your goals with a supportive loved one, both\\nto get their insight and to provide some accountability for yourself.\\nSimply telling someone our intentions can raise our motivation to follow\\nthrough.\\n6Finally, if you think of any additional goals, add them to your list.CHAPTER THREE\\nActivate Behavior\\nWhen depression sets in, we often withdraw from many activities due to\\nlow energy and a lack of interest. Although this response is understandable,\\nit frequently leads to more severe depression symptoms.\\nBeth’s depression started so subtly she didn’t even notice it. She had\\nbeen very busy between new responsibilities at work and the start of the\\nschool year for her kids. Then her mom had gotten sick, which added a\\nlayer of stress and additional demands on Beth’s time. When she started\\nto feel run down, she backed off her exercise routine to try to conserve\\nenergy. She also found it hard to concentrate, so she’d stopped her\\nnightly reading before bedtime, and she rarely got together with her\\nfriends anymore. She used to go out to lunch with her coworkers a few\\ntimes a week, but now she stayed at her desk, declining their invitations.\\nOccasionally Beth spent a few moments on the weekends sitting outside\\non her deck watching the trees and the birds, and sometimes she would\\nwatch a TV show with her husband. Otherwise Beth’s days consisted\\nalmost entirely of taking care of her many responsibilities at work, at\\nhome, and with her ailing mother.\\nDepression caused Beth’s world to shrink, as it does for so many people.\\nHer mood worsened as she did fewer things for pleasure, and she\\nstarted to see herself as someone who couldn’t handle exercising or\\ngetting together with friends. She could still take care of her work\\nactivities but found very little joy or pleasure in her life, and felt like\\nshe’d aged a decade in the past year. Beth looked forward to feeling\\nbetter so she could be more active again.\\nBeth’s circumstances were a perfect recipe for depression: being\\noverextended emotionally and having very few enjoyable activities. In order\\nto feel well, we need a balance of enjoyable and important things to do—or\\nin the words of Dr. Aaron T. Beck, we need experiences of “pleasure and\\nmastery.”If we pursue only fun things and neglect our responsibilities, we’ll\\nstarve ourselves of a sense of accomplishment. On the other hand, we need\\nto balance our work with play. If we’re fortunate, we’ll have activities that\\ngive us both—for example, some people may find cooking doubly\\nrewarding, as both an enjoyable aesthetic experience and an essential task to\\nfeed their family.\\nWhy Do We Avoid Activities?\\nBeth’s avoidance makes sense if we consider the short- and long-term\\nconsequences of her behavior. For example, when her coworkers invite her\\nto lunch, she thinks about the energy she’ll have to muster to make\\nconversation and the possible questions she’ll face about how she’s doing. It\\nall feels overwhelming, and eating at her desk feels safe and predictable.\\nEach time she closes her office door and eats alone, she feels a sense of\\nrelief, which reinforces her pattern of avoidance.\\nAt the same time, Beth is forgetting the positives that come from eating\\nwith her work friends. While she might feel awkward at first, in the past she\\nhad really enjoyed herself at the group lunches. She would often return to\\nher office feeling energized for the afternoon. She was also missing out on\\nthe support her friends would offer.\\nTwo powerful factors drive avoidance of activities:\\n1An immediate sense of relief from dodging what we think will be\\ndifficult\\n2Not experiencing the reward from engaging in the activity, thereby\\nfurther diminishing our motivation for it\\nBehavioral activation is designed to break these patterns.Lead with Action\\nLike Beth, many of us are waiting to feel better so we can get back to the\\nthings we used to enjoy. However, it’s much more efficient to gradually\\nstart doing rewarding activities, even if we don’t feel like it. The interest in\\nthe activities will follow. This approach is the foundation of behavioral\\nactivation for depression.\\nThink of it like starting an exercise program. At first, you may have\\nvery little motivation to go to the gym. Your body may not be used to\\nphysical activity, and you might feel more pain than reward from your\\nworkout. But if you stick with it, the balance will begin to shift. You’ll start\\nto enjoy the exercise high from endorphins. You’ll notice you have more\\nenergy, which will motivate you to continue. You might start to look\\nforward to seeing your new friends at the gym. If you had waited till you\\nfelt like exercising, you might have never started. Behavioral activation\\nworks the same way.\\n“Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together;\\nand by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the\\nwill, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.” —William James\\n(1911)\\nStrategies for Meeting Goals\\nIn the previous chapter, you identified your important goals. Behavioral\\nactivation provides a systematic plan that can be a crucial part of reaching\\nthese goals.\\nSteve had been severely depressed five years ago and had recovered\\nthrough CBT. Now he was facing many challenges all at once and could\\nfeel himself starting to sink into a depression again. He knew it was time\\nto deploy the techniques he’d learned in therapy.\\nSTEP 1: CLARIFY V ALUES FOR EACH LIFE DOMAINThe first step in behavioral activation is to determine what’s important to us\\nin the particular domain we’re trying to make a change in. What do we\\nvalue in that area? When we’re clear about our values, we’re more likely to\\nfind rewarding activities that derive from them.\\nSteve had several goals for his relationships, which had suffered in the\\npast few months. As he thought about these goals, he recognized that\\nshowing love to his partner was really important to him. He also valued\\nmaking his kids feel important and having adventures with friends.\\nLook at your goals. Which domains do they fall under, and what do you\\nvalue in each of those areas? You can use the Value and Activities form to\\nwrite down your values in each life area. We’ll come up with activities in\\nthe next step, so skip those blanks for now.\\nIf you find you’re struggling to pinpoint your values, don’t get hung up\\non this step. Feel free to move ahead to step 2 and start coming up with\\nactivities. Sometimes it’s easier to identify values based on what we like to\\ndo. For example, I might realize based on activities I’ve listed that meeting\\nnew people is important to me. Identifying that value can then help me\\nbrainstorm other ways of meeting new people.\\nOur values can help us come up with activities that support them, and activities we find r ewar ding\\ncan clue us in to what we value.\\nVALUES & ACTIVITIES FORM\\nRELA TIONSHIPS\\nValue: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------Activity:

of this form online at CallistoMediaBooks.com/CBTMadeSimple.WHAT ARE VALUES IN BEHAVIORAL\\nACTIVATION?\\nThe word value can mean many different things. In behavioral\\nactivation, it simply refers to what is important to you—nothing more\\ncomplicated than that. It helps to divide your values into life areas to\\nmake them easier to recognize. Keep in mind that:\\n•Values have no endpoint and, unlike goals and activities, they\\ncontinue indefinitely.\\n•They tend to end in -ing. For example, being a good friend, enjoying\\ntime in nature, and learning about the world. Conversely, sign up for\\na botany class is an activity with an end.\\n•Values are often tied closely to our self-concept, as they reflect the\\nkind of person we want to be.\\n•They can be as grand or as modest as you want them to be.\\n•Values are personal and vary a lot between individuals.\\nSTEP 2: IDENTIFY LIFE-GIVING ACTIVITIES\\nSteve thought of ways he used to show love to his partner when he was\\nfeeling better—things like rubbing her shoulders in the evening and\\nmaking her breakfast on the weekend. He started making a list of\\nactivities he would like to do more often.\\nThink of activities that fall under each of the values you identified and\\nadd them to the form where you recorded your values. Make sure they’re\\nthings that have a high probability of bringing you either enjoyment or a\\nsense of accomplishment; otherwise there’s no reward. Don’t hesitate to list\\nactivities you may not be able to do at this point—it’s good to have a range\\nof difficulty in your activities, including ones to grow toward. Don’t worry\\nif some of your activities feel trivial; every bit of progress counts on the\\nroad to recovery.If you struggled to identify values in step 1, see if your list of activities\\nprovides any clues. You can then use the values you identify to come up\\nwith additional activities.\\nBe careful not to downplay the importance of having fun as you’re doing\\nbehavioral activation. Sometimes we consider our enjoyment frivolous,\\nbelieving we have more serious things to attend to. In reality, finding joy is\\nserious business and one of the best ways to relieve depression.\\nSTEP 3: RA TE THE DIFFICUL TY OF EACH ACTIVITY\\nSome of the activities you wrote down are probably things you’re doing\\nalready and feel are fairly easy. Others may feel out of reach at this point.\\nStill others will fall between these extremes. I like a simple three-point\\nrating scale for these levels of difficulty—1 for easy, 2 for moderate, and 3\\nfor hard—but feel free to use whatever ratings work for you. The important\\nthing is that the items are rated relative to each other.\\nSteve found it was easy to take time to play with his kids, while having a\\ndate night with his wife would require more effort. He knew he’d have to\\nwork up to planning a family weekend getaway, which felt impossibly\\ncomplicated. Steve rated these activities accordingly:\\nACTIVITY DIFFICUL TY\\nPlaying with kids 1\\nDate night 2\\nWeekend family getaway 3\\nGo through your list and assign a rating to each activity. If you find it’s\\nhard to decide how difficult something will be, just give it your best guess.\\nSTEP 4 : PLAN THE ORDER OF COMPLETION\\nNow that you have a good idea of how challenging each activity will be,\\nyou can plan which ones to start with. You don’t have to arrange all the\\nactivities in order, but pick at least 5 to 10 that will get you started. That\\nway you’ll have a road map to follow over the coming days and you won’tlose momentum trying to decide what to do next. You can always make\\nadjustments as you go. Consider including activities from different life\\nareas to provide a variety of rewards.\\nSTEP 5: SCHEDULE ACTIVITIES INT O A CALENDAR\\nThe more specific we are about scheduling and executing our plans, the\\nmore likely we are to complete them:\\n•Pick a time for each activity you intend to do and put it in your calendar.\\nAim to match the activity with the best time of day for you. For\\nexample, scheduling exercise first thing in the morning might work great\\nfor a morning person but would not set a night owl up for success.\\n•Plan at least a day in advance so when you wake up in the morning\\nyou’ll know what’s on your agenda for that day.\\n•Schedule events further out if they require advance planning, like going\\non a trip.\\n•Bigger tasks may need to be broken into smaller steps and scheduled\\naccordingly (see Break Down Big Tasks).\\nIf you’re reluctant to put things in a calendar, consider trying it and\\nseeing how it works. Most of us are more likely to complete a task if we’ve\\ndedicated a specific time for it. Otherwise it’s easy to keep pushing it off.\\nSTEP 6: COMPLETE THE ACTIVITIES\\nWhen the time comes for your planned activities, make every effort to\\nfollow through with them. It may be especially difficult in the beginning\\nwhen motivation is still low. Remember that every valued activity you\\ncomplete brings you closer to your goals.\\nBefore you complete each activity, set an intention to be as fully present\\nfor it as possible. For example, if you’re at the gym, really be at the gym:\\nsee what’s around you, feel what you feel, notice what you hear. Let\\nyourself be fully in the experience. This level of presence will help you get\\nthe most out of each activity, and has the added benefit of making it harderto get stuck in problematic mind-sets like obsessive worry. We’ll address\\nthese ideas in more depth in chapter 6.\\nApplying Behavioral Activation to Your Goals\\nBehavioral activation is closely tied to achievement of your goals. Let’s\\nconsider how the structure of this approach relates to the goals you set in\\nchapter 2.\\nSteve’s number one goal was to improve his closest relationships. As he\\nstarted behavioral activation, he focused on moderately easy activities\\ninvolving his family members and close friends. In the process, he\\nrealized he needed to tend to his own needs in order to be the husband,\\nfather, and friend he intended to be. For example, he realized he was\\nmore agreeable toward others when he went to the gym a few times a\\nweek and ate healthy foods, so Steve added these activities to his list.\\nValues give rise to goals, and we r each those goals by planning and completing specific activities.\\nConsider how your own goals r elate to your values and activities. How will completing your\\nactivities help you meet your goals?\\nBUILD A GAME PLAN AROUND YOUR GOALS\\nBehavioral activation offers a step-by-step approach to reach your goals. It’s\\na lot like a team’s goal of winning the championship—they’ll need a plan\\nfor each game to make their goal a reality. Thus, the goals you set willguide the activities you choose and your activities will move you toward\\nyour goals. For Steve, being an involved parent was a value that gave rise to\\nthe goal to read one book to my two-year-old every day. To address that\\ngoal, he planned the specific activity of read to my two-year-old every night\\nbefore bed.\\nWORK PROGRESSIVEL Y TOWARD GOALS\\nBehavioral activation can bring you closer to your eventual goal by creating\\na series of increasingly challenging steps. For example, a person might have\\na goal to exercise 45 minutes a day, five times a week. A workout of that\\nlength might be a difficulty level 3 in behavioral activation, so an\\nintermediate activity could be a light 15-minute workout. The success we\\nfind in the easier initial steps lays the foundation for more difficult—and\\nrewarding—activities.\\nTHINK HOLISTICALL Y\\nAs Steve realized, the areas of our life don’t exist in isolation. Just as\\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors are intimately connected, our life domains\\nintersect:\\n•Stress from work or relationships disrupts your sleep.\\n•A friend’s unwavering support and concern deepen your sense of\\nmeaning and your trust in humanity.\\n•Struggles with addiction affect nearly every area of a person’s life.\\n•A relaxing weekend increases our productivity at work on Monday.\\nAs you think about activities that will help you move toward your goals,\\nthink three-dimensionally. For example, could tending to your domestic\\nresponsibilities affect your relationships? Could eating better make you a\\nmore productive worker? Progress in different areas of your life is likely to\\nbe mutually reinforcing.\\nWork Through RoadblocksBehavioral activation is one of the best-supported treatments for depression,\\nin part because it’s so simple. And yet that simplicity doesn’t make it easy.\\nEven when we intend to follow the previous steps, there will be times we\\ndon’t complete our plans. When that happens, the number one thing to\\nremember is to be compassionate with yourself. Remember that you’re\\nhuman and that this work is hard.\\nPart of compassion is understanding how our minds work and creating\\nthe conditions that set us up for success. Sure, we can criticize ourselves\\nand try to use sheer force of will to become more active, but there are\\nstrategies that can give us greater leverage to complete our plans. Let’s\\nconsider some of the most effective approaches.\\nMAKE SURE T ASKS ARE REW ARDING\\nA common reason we don’t complete our tasks is that they simply don’t\\nprovide any satisfaction. For example, we might have decided to start\\nrunning consistently, but in fact we’ve always hated running. Or maybe\\nwe’re trying to return to activities we used to enjoy, but our interests have\\nchanged.\\nIf you find you’re not getting to the tasks you’ve set for yourself, think\\nabout the incentive that you have to do them. Is the activity worth doing,\\nbut you haven’t been able to muster the motivation for it? Or is your\\nmotivation low because the activity isn’t right for you? Choose substitute\\nactivities if you decide a task just isn’t rewarding—for example, maybe you\\nused to love biographies and now you’re more drawn to fiction. Go where\\nyour heart leads.\\nBREAK DOWN BIG T ASKS\\nAnother common reason we don’t follow through on our plans is that they\\nfeel daunting. We might be interested in an activity and would find it\\nrewarding, but we can’t get ourselves to tackle it.\\nSteve had been meaning to do the fall cleanup in his garden, but\\nsomehow kept not getting to it. He realized he felt overwhelmed by the\\njob, which by this point had grown to include raking leaves, cutting thegrass, clearing out his vegetable beds, and several other tasks. Steve\\ndecided to start by making a list of the individual tasks he needed to do,\\nand then he chose just one to get started. He was able to clear out the\\nbeds, and once he started working he decided to keep going through\\nseveral other items on his list.\\nMomentum is invaluable when we’re working to become more active.\\nLike Steve, we can make our tasks small enough to get started, thereby\\npaving the way for continued success. As you review your list of activities,\\nsee if any of them need to be broken down into smaller pieces. Use your gut\\nfeeling as an indicator—when you imagine doing an activity, do you feel a\\nsense of resistance and dread? If so, break it down to make it more\\nmanageable. Don’t be afraid to make the pieces as small as it takes to get\\nstarted. For yard work it might be find my work boots. The important thing\\nis finding a way forward, no matter how modest the step.\\nPLAN ACTIVITIES FOR SPECIFIC TIMES\\nIf you’ve struggled to complete one of your tasks, make sure you set aside a\\ntime to do it. Sometimes we resist making a specific plan because our\\nschedule is uncertain or we like to have flexibility. But sometimes we might\\nhave mixed feelings about an activity, and leaving the timing open-ended is\\na way to give ourselves an out if we don’t feel like doing it. By putting the\\nactivity in our calendar, we increase our commitment to completing it. It’s a\\ngood idea to set an alert, too, to remind us when the time comes. Also, do\\neverything you can to prevent scheduling over your plans. Make getting\\nback to life a real priority.\\nMAKE YOURSELF ACCOUNT ABLE\\nWriting down your plans and putting them in your calendar are ways of\\nincreasing accountability to yourself. We can also be accountable to others\\nto provide extra leverage for our follow-through. People I treat often say\\nthat having to “report” to me gives them more incentive to complete their\\nhomework.Is there someone you could tell about an activity you’ve struggled to\\ncomplete? Choose an accountability partner carefully—ideally it will be\\nsomeone who encourages you and isn’t critical or punitive if you don’t\\ncomplete something. It can also help to have someone who wants to do the\\nactivities with you, like going for lunchtime walks with a coworker.\\nThrough accountability, you’ll encourage one another’s consistency.\\nFOCUS ON COMPLETING ONE T ASK A T A TIME\\nWhen we’ve planned several activities in advance, we might feel\\noverwhelmed by the list. Rather than feeling good about doing our first\\nactivity, we might be focused on the other nine still ahead of us. If you find\\nyourself worried about future tasks, remind yourself that the only thing you\\nneed to be doing at the time is exactly what you’re doing. This singular\\nfocus will have another benefit—helping you get the most out of the\\nexperience, which will maximize its reward value.\\nADDRESS PROBLEMA TIC THOUGHTS\\nAs the CBT model makes clear, our behaviors are closely tied to our\\nthoughts and feelings. Certain thoughts can get in the way of doing our\\nplanned tasks.\\nSteve caught himself thinking, “Maybe I should just skip the gym this\\nmorning—it probably won’t make me feel any better.” When he thought\\nabout it more, he remembered many times when the gym did raise his\\nmood. He decided to do his workout and treat it like an experiment,\\nseeing if it might actually be helpful.\\nOther thoughts can minimize the feeling of accomplishment we get\\nfrom completing a task (e.g., “That easy task was nothing—wait till I get to\\nthe hard stuff”), reducing the reward we get from it. Every step in the right\\ndirection counts, so treat even the smallest step as an achievement.\\nIf you find your thoughts are interfering with your work in behavioral\\nactivation, I encourage you to read chapter 4: Identify and Break Negative\\nThought Patterns.Tracking Your Activities\\nIt’s a good idea to keep track of how you’re spending your time when\\nimplementing behavioral activation. You can use the Daily Activities form.\\nThere are several advantages to keeping track of what we do:\\n•Just paying attention to our schedule can lead us to be more active.\\n•You’ll probably discover some periods of time where you’ll be able to\\nadd rewarding activities.\\n•You’ll be able to track your progress over the coming weeks.\\n•You can use the same form for scheduling and recording your valued\\nactivities.\\nChapter Summary and Homework\\nThis chapter covered the principles of behavioral activation, a simple and\\nhighly effective way to reengage with life and lift our mood. It involves a\\nsystematic plan for building rewarding activities into our lives, thus making\\nour days more satisfying and enjoyable. We also covered strategies to make\\nbehavioral activation work for you when you run into obstacles, which we\\nall are prone to do.\\nTechniques from subsequent chapters fit well with behavioral\\nactivation, such as breaking negative thought patterns, pushing through\\nprocrastination, and practicing self-care.\\nAt this point you are prepared to:\\n1Track your activities using the Daily Activities form.\\n2Follow the six-step plan to build valued activities into your days. It may\\nbe enough to do steps 1 through 4 this week, and to schedule activities\\nfor the following week.\\n3Choose one to two activities to complete per day, starting with the easier\\nones.\\n4Use the strategies offered to raise the odds of following through.5Continue choosing activities from your list and scheduling them in your\\ncalendar.

Now we turn our attention\\nto another core skill in CBT: tending to our thoughts.\\nSusan had had a tough year. Her work responsibilities had greatly\\nincreased, and around the same time she discovered a profound betrayal\\nin her marriage. As a result, her sleep had been poor for many months\\nand she now felt overwhelmed and depressed.\\nIn her recent performance review meeting, Susan was crushed to hear\\nthat her boss thought her performance was slipping. She talked about it\\nwith her friend Cathy over their lunch break, and was embarrassed\\nwhen she began crying. “My home life’s a mess, I’m failing at work—I\\njust feel totally inept,” Susan said.\\nAs they talked about it, Cathy helped Susan consider aspects of the\\nsituation she hadn’t considered. For example, she reminded Susan that\\nshe had greater work responsibilities because she was so well regarded\\nin her job and had been promoted accordingly. This conversation\\nhelped Susan gain a fresh perspective that boosted her mood.\\nIn this chapter I invite you to be like Susan’s friend—but to yourself.\\nYou can do this by really listening to what you’re telling yourself, which\\nwill give you a chance to catch lies and half-truths that have powerful\\neffects on your emotions.\\nIt’s much easier to spot the errors in someone else’s thinking than in our\\nown. If the roles had been reversed, Susan would have had no problem\\npointing out how much better Cathy was doing than she thought. We tend to\\nhave blind spots with our own thinking, so I’ll introduce a structured\\napproach to monitoring and challenging our negative thought patterns.\\nThe Power of ThoughtsFor something that can’t be seen, heard, or measured, thoughts have\\nincredible power. Our mood for an entire day can hinge on how we interpret\\na single disappointment. Thoughts can also have a profound effect on our\\nbehavior, affecting whether we forgive or retaliate, engage or withdraw,\\npersevere or give up. No matter what you’ve been struggling with, chances\\nare that your thoughts have played a role, either in causing your distress or\\nin prolonging it.\\nIn CBT, these distressing thoughts are called negative automatic\\nthoughts because they come with no effort on our part. It’s as though our\\nminds have minds of their own, and certain triggers will cue these\\nautomatic ways of thinking. Just as our thoughts can cause us unnecessary\\npain, they can also help us heal if we harness them to work in our favor. The\\nword harness is perfect in this context because it means to control\\nsomething in order to make use of it. As we’ll see in this chapter and the\\nnext, we can not only stop our thoughts from tearing us down, but also can\\nuse them to build ourselves up.\\nLet’s return to Susan, who’s having a rough day. On her rainy drive\\nhome from work, she rear-ended the car in front of her. After she sorted\\nthings out with the other driver—who was not terribly friendly about it\\n—she sat in her car and did what all of us do when something upsetting\\nhappens: she thought about it.\\nSusan’s first thought was, “That’s one more thing I’ve messed up—now\\nthey’ll raise my insurance rates.” And then the image of her friend\\nCathy came to mind and she wondered what she would tell Cathy if she\\nhad caused a fender bender. Susan definitely would not speak to Cathy\\nwith the internal voice she directed at herself. She imagined telling her\\nfriend, “It was raining and you were in a hurry to get home after a long\\nday at work. You’re human. Don’t beat yourself up.”\\nSusan felt the frown on her face relax as she looked out her rain-\\nstreaked window. “Maybe Cathy was right,” she thought. “Maybe I’m\\ndoing better than I think.” She even smiled to herself a little\\nremembering how grumpy the man she’d rear-ended had been. She felt\\nproud of herself for having kept her composure with him as they\\nexchanged insurance information. She saw that her positivity hadcaused the man to drop his rough tone. “I guess I handled that all\\nright,” she thought to herself as she continued the drive home.\\nOur thoughts often serve us well, helping us make wise decisions. At\\nother times, our thinking is skewed. Psychologists have demonstrated many\\nbiases that are built into the human psyche and these biases can be\\nespecially pronounced when we’re experiencing extreme emotional states\\nlike anger or depression.\\nFor example, I might believe someone is deliberately trying to\\nembarrass me, when in fact their intentions are completely benign. The\\nmore often we make these kinds of thinking errors, the more likely we’ll\\nexperience conditions like severe anxiety. Let’s consider a plan for\\nidentifying and addressing these errors.\\nHow to Identify Problematic Thoughts\\nIt would be easy to catch our negative thought patterns if they announced\\nthemselves: Hey, here’s an overly negative thought—don’t take it too\\nseriously. Unfortunately, we tend to assume our thoughts reflect an\\nimpartial take on reality. Ideas like “I am such a disappointment,” seem as\\nobjective as “The earth is round.”\\nFor this reason, we have to be cleverer than our thoughts. Thankfully\\nour minds don’t just produce thoughts, they also have the ability to notice\\nand evaluate them. But which thoughts, from our continuous stream of\\nthem, should we give attention to?\\nThere are several clues that problematic thoughts may be present:\\nYou feel a sudden shift toward negative emotion. Maybe you suddenly\\nfelt dispirited or you experienced a jolt of anxiety. Perhaps you sensed a\\nsurge of resentment. If we pay attention at these times, we’ll likely discover\\nthoughts that are driving the emotional shift.\\nYou can’t seem to shake a negative feeling. Being stuck in an emotional\\nstate suggests there are thought patterns maintaining it. For example, you\\nmight notice you’ve been irritable all morning or have been carrying a senseof dread for a lot of the day. Most likely there are thoughts feeding those\\nfeelings.\\nYou’re struggling to act in line with your goals. Maybe you can’t get\\nyourself to follow through on plans you’ve made or you keep finding\\nreasons not to face your fears. For example, a student might keep putting off\\nwriting a paper, driven by the thought, “It’s not going to be any good.” In\\ncontrast, the right thoughts can propel us to action.\\nTHINKING ERRORS\\nPsychiatrists Aaron T. Beck, David D. Burns, and others have\\ndeveloped lists of thinking errors called “cognitive distortions.”\\nSome common ones are summarized below.\\nTHINKING ERROR DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE\\nBlack-and-white thinkingSeeing things in extreme\\nterms“If I do poorly on this\\nexam, I’m a total idiot.”\\nShouldingThinking the way we want\\nthings to be is the way they\\nought to be“I should have been more\\npatient.”\\nOvergeneralizati onBelieving that one instance\\napplies to every situation“I don’ t know the answer to\\nthe first question on this\\nexam, so I’m probably not\\ngoing to know the answers\\nto any questions.”\\nCatastr ophizingThinking a situation is\\nmuch worse than it is“A customer got really mad\\nat me today , so my boss\\nwill probably fire me.”\\nDiscounting the positiveMinimizing evidence that\\ncontradicts one’ s negative\\nautomatic thoughts“She said ‘yes’ when I\\nasked her out only because\\nshe felt sorry for me.”\\nEmotional r easoningAssuming our feelings\\nconvey useful information“My nervousness about\\nflying means there’ s a good\\nchance my plane will\\ncrash.”Fortune telling Making predictions based\\non scant information“The rental company\\nprobably won’ t have any\\ncars left.”\\nMind r eadingAssuming we know what\\nsomeone else is thinking“They probably thought I\\nlooked like an idiot when I\\ncouldn’ t get my slides to\\nload.”\\nPersonalizationThinking events that have\\nnothing to do with us are\\nactually about us“She seems upset—it’ s\\nprobably because of\\nsomething I did.”\\nEntitlementExpecting to reach a\\ncertain outcome based on\\nour actions or position“I deserve to be promoted\\nafter working so hard.”\\nOutsour cing happinessGiving outside factors the\\nfinal say regarding our\\nemotions“I can’ t be happy unless\\nothers give me the respect I\\ndeserve.”\\nFalse sense of helplessnessBelieving we have less\\npower than we actually do“There’ s no point in\\napplying for jobs—\\nnobody’ s going to hire me.”\\nFalse sense of\\nresponsibilityBelieving we have more\\npower than we actually do“If I were a more\\ninteresting speaker , nobody\\nwould ever yawn during\\nmy talks.”\\nSometimes the answer will be obvious when we ask ourselves what\\nwe’re thinking. Other times it won’t be immediately apparent. Here are\\nsome tips for figuring out what we’re thinking:\\n1Keep in mind that the thoughts may be about the past, present, or future.\\n•Past: “I sounded like an idiot.”\\n•Present: “I’m blowing this interview.”\\n•Future: “I’m going to get sick from all this stress.”\\n2Give yourself the space you need to identify what’s on your mind, which\\nmight include:\\n•Finding a quiet place to think for a moment•Closing your eyes and visualizing what just happened\\n•Taking a few slow breaths\\n3Be aware that thoughts might come as impressions or images rather than\\nwords. For example:\\n•Imagining losing your train of thought and staring blankly at your\\naudience\\n•Picturing having an accident while driving\\n•Having a vague sense of being somehow inadequate\\nRecording Your Thoughts\\nIf you’re new to CBT, or it’s been a while since you practiced it, I\\nrecommend taking some time to record your thoughts and their effects\\nbefore starting to challenge them. Don’t be surprised, though, if you\\nspontaneously begin to adjust your way of thinking simply by being more\\naware of your thoughts. Our minds have an easier time recognizing things\\nthat aren’t true once we start to notice the stories we tell ourselves. We\\nusually assume that events cause emotions or actions, skipping over the\\ninterpretation we made. In CBT, we work to identify the thoughts between\\nan event and an emotion or a behavior.\\nWhen Susan had her disappointing performance review, she was aware\\nof:\\nBut the review per se didn’t have the power to affect her emotionally.\\nInstead it was Susan’s interpretation of what the review meant that drove\\nher emotional response:\\nThe emotion Susan felt makes perfect sense once we know what her\\nthoughts were. We can also examine the link between thoughts and\\nbehaviors. For example, we might be trying to get out more but we turned\\ndown an invitation to meet up with a friend. This sequence could look like:\\nWhen you encounter emotional challenges over the coming days, use\\nthis template to record your thoughts. You can find a blank form online at\\nCallistoMediaBooks.com/CBTMadeSimple.\\nKeep in mind that identifying thoughts takes practice. While we can get\\nbetter at it quickly, there is always room to grow in seeing what our minds\\nare up to. Our thoughts can have even more power when we consider the\\nCBT model of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Recall that each of these\\ncomponents affects the others, such that the feelings and behaviors our\\nthoughts promote will in turn further affect our thoughts. Thus, a single\\nnegative thought can be amplified because its effects reverberate through\\nour feelings and behaviors.GETTING T O THE BOTT OM OF YOUR THOUGHTS\\nSometimes when we think we’ve identified a negative automatic thought,\\nwe’re not sure why it’s upsetting us. For example, imagine you’re getting\\ndressed in the morning and when you look in the mirror you think your shirt\\nlooks too small for you. Your mood dips dramatically and you change your\\noutfit. As you realize what’s happening, you think back to the event and\\nwrite down:\\nIt’s hard to understand how this thought led you to feel ashamed of\\nyourself and depressed. Furthermore, there’s no apparent error in thinking\\n—you do need a bigger shirt. If there seems to be a mismatch between a\\nthought and its effects, we can use the “downward arrow technique” to look\\nfor the actual negative automatic thought. Most likely there is a more\\nupsetting belief that’s affecting our feelings and actions.\\nWith the downward arrow technique, we explore the implications of our\\nthoughts—what does it mean? In this example, we would ask what it meansthat your shirt looks too small. The name of the technique comes from the\\ndownward arrows we draw as we trace the line of thinking:\\nNotice that with each downward arrow we get to increasingly\\ndistressing thoughts, with the last two being truly disheartening. Now it’s\\neasier to understand feeling ashamed and depressed. You can use the\\ndownward arrow technique whenever you need to dig deeper to identify a\\nnegative automatic thought.Common Themes in Our Thoughts\\nDifferent types of thoughts lead to different patterns of emotion and\\nbehavior.

For example, feeling angry suggests we believe we’ve been\\nmistreated. Examples of typical thoughts for different conditions include the\\nfollowing examples.\\nAnxiety“What if I get sick or hurt and can’ t work anymore?” “People will see me\\nblushing and think I’m an idiot.” “It’ s dangerous to have a panic attack while\\ndriving.”\\nDepr ession“I can’ t do anything right.” “I’m letting everyone down.” “People would be\\nbetter of f without me.”\\nAnger“Nobody else pulls their weight around here.” “She’ s treating me like I’m an\\nidiot.” “I’ve been treated very unfairly .”\\nBreaking Negative Thought Patterns\\nOnce you’ve gotten good at recognizing the thoughts that are tied to\\nnegative emotions, it’s time to take a closer look at those thoughts.\\nGeorge is a graduate student in psychology. He taught his first class last\\nsemester and was very disappointed to read several negative comments\\nabout his teaching in his course evaluations. His impression after\\nreading the evaluations was that most of them were critical. As a result,he began to question his fitness to pursue his dream of becoming a\\ncollege professor.\\nHowever, when he looked through the evaluations a second time, he\\ncounted about a 10:1 ratio of positive to negative comments. He also\\nrealized most of the negative comments were things he was already\\naware of and could work to improve, like being a more dynamic\\npresenter. “Maybe there’s still hope for my academic career,” George\\nthought to himself.\\nThe main strategy to break negative thought patterns is to compare our\\nthoughts to reality. Are we telling ourselves something reasonable, or are\\nour thoughts a poor reflection of the actual situation? Don’t worry that\\nyou’ll have to put on rose-colored glasses and fool yourself into believing\\nthings are better than they are. We’re just going to see if our thoughts are\\naligned with the evidence.\\nFOLLOW THE F ACTS\\nThe following series of steps will allow you to identify possible errors in\\nyour thinking.\\nStep 1: Look for evidence that supports your thought\\nAre there real reasons to believe your negative thoughts? In George’s\\nsituation, he had a few critical evaluations that supported his thought about\\nbeing a bad instructor. Take care at this step to be as objective as possible,\\nneither skipping over any available evidence nor filtering the evidence\\nthrough a negative lens.\\nStep 2: Look for evidence that does not support your thought\\nIs there anything your thought ignores, as George ignored the\\npreponderance of positive evaluations? Or maybe you acknowledged this\\nother side of the evidence but downplayed it, just as George knew he also\\nhad positive comments but thought it was “just a few” and that they were\\n“just being nice.” Counting the number of positive and negative evaluations\\ngave him an objective measure. You might also think about what you wouldtell a friend in your situation. What would you point out that they might\\nhave ignored?\\nStep 3: Look for possible errors in your thinking\\nNext, compare your original thought with the evidence you’ve gathered. Do\\nyou find any thinking errors, like those listed here? Notice also if you got\\nthe facts right but misinterpreted their meaning. For example, George was\\nright that he needed to improve his teaching, but had catastrophized when\\nhe assumed it meant he wasn’t cut out to be a professor. So ask yourself\\nwhether your thought means what you’ve assumed. Even if it’s true, is it as\\nbad as it seems? Write down any errors you discover.\\nStep 4: Identify a more accurate and helpful way of seeing the situation\\nHow can you modify your initial thought to make it more consistent with\\nreality? Take care to come up with a thought that is supported by facts,\\nrather than a generic self-affirmation or a simple rebuttal of the automatic\\nthought. For example, George might try to counteract his negative\\nautomatic thoughts about his teaching by saying, “I’m actually an amazing\\nteacher,” but that thought carries little weight, because it’s simply an\\nopinion and not one George really believes. Remember, there’s no need to\\ntry to trick yourself into better thinking. Simply follow the facts and write\\ndown the alternative way of thinking.\\nStep 5: Notice and record any effects of the new thought on your\\nfeelings and behaviors\\nAs we practice new ways of thinking, we’ll start to experience changes in\\nour feelings and behaviors. Take note of any effects you’re aware of. As\\nalways, be honest with yourself, even if that means saying you didn’t notice\\nany improvement in your feelings and behaviors. It will be valuable to\\nknow what works for you and what doesn’t.\\nThe following example illustrates how Kayla, a working mother of four,\\nused this approach when she forgot to call her mom on her 65th birthday.Evidence for my thought Evidence against my thought\\n•I forgot to call my mom on\\na special birthday.\\n•I also forgot to send my\\nparents an anniversary card a\\nfew years ago.\\n•I don’t always remember\\nmy friends’ birthdays.•Every other year I’ve\\nremembered to call my parents\\non their birthdays.\\n•I often do nice things for my\\nfriends’ birthdays.\\n•I was busy taking my sick\\ndaughter to the doctor on my\\nmom’s birthday.\\n•I’m very considerate now of\\npossibly having hurt my\\nmom’s feelings.\\n•I thought to call her on her\\nbirthday but not when I was\\nable to.\\nWere there any errors in your thinking?\\nOvergeneralization—I assumed this one mistake defines me as a\\npersonWhat is a more accurate and helpful way of looking at the\\nsituation?\\nI was busy with work and my daughter’s illness, and did intend to\\ncall my mother. In the future, I can set reminders to make it harder to\\nforget, but the bottom line is that it’s not the end of the world, and\\nmy mom was very understanding about it when I finally made the\\ncall.\\nWhat are the ef fects of the new thought?\\nI no longer felt guilty or sad, and it felt good to remember the nice\\nthings I do for others.\\nWhen starting out, it’s best to follow the structure of the written exercise.\\nWith practice, we can put aside the formal recording of our thoughts and\\nsimply catch and correct our faulty thinking in real time.\\nChapter Summary and Homework\\nThis chapter introduced the crucial skills of recognizing and breaking our\\nnegative thought patterns. You learned to look for clues and to listen closely\\nto discover what your mind is telling you. You also considered a plan for\\ntesting those thoughts against reality.\\nWith practice, you’ll probably find recurring themes that show up in\\nyour thoughts. These themes are evidence for underlying beliefs that give\\nrise to the negative automatic thoughts, a topic we discuss in the next\\nchapter.\\nFor now, I invite you to take the following action steps:\\n1Pay attention for clues that negative automatic thoughts may be at work\\n(e.g., a sudden drop in mood).\\n2Practice recording negative automatic thoughts using the form here.3Follow the downward arrow technique as needed to drill down to your\\nactual distressing thoughts.\\n4Once you feel comfortable with identifying your thoughts, use the five-\\nstep plan to start testing them for accuracy.\\n5As you gain experience catching and clarifying your thoughts, begin to\\ndo so in the moment, without writing things down.\\n6Return to the full written technique as needed for more challenging\\nthoughts or to tune up your practice.\\nEvidence for my thought Evidence against my thought\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\\nWere there any errors in your thinking?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n--------------------------------------------------What is a more accurate and helpful way of looking at the situation?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nWhat are the effects of the new thought?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nYou can find a copy of this form online at CallistoMediaBooks.com/CBTMadeSimple.CHAPTER FIVE\\nIdentify and Change Your Core Beliefs\\nIn chapter 4, we looked at ways to discover and change our negative\\nautomatic thoughts. If you’re new to CBT, I definitely recommend reading\\nchapter 4 before continuing with this one. In this chapter, we are going to\\nexplore what drives those negative thoughts. Why do our minds produce\\nthose thinking patterns so quickly and effortlessly? We’ll delve deeper into\\nthe nature of our thought processes and will find there are deep-seated\\nbeliefs that underlie our everyday thoughts—and that we can modify\\nthrough CBT.\\n“Do you mind zipping me up?” Maura asked Simon as they got ready\\nfor the holiday party. “There you go,” he said as he pulled up the zipper\\nand fastened the clasp above it. Maura turned to inspect her dress in the\\nmirror and Simon thought with a touch of irritation, “A ‘thanks’\\nwould’ve been nice.” Later, as they were leaving, Simon asked Maura if\\nshe wanted him to grab the salad she’d made. “Oh, sure,” she replied,\\nand again Simon felt mildly annoyed. It seemed petty to insist she say\\n“please” and “thank you,” but Simon felt like the small favor he did for\\nMaura wasn’t appreciated. He resisted the urge to say a sarcastic,\\n“You’re welcome” as he brought the salad to the car.\\nAt other times, Simon feels like his wife doesn’t see how hard he works\\nor know how stressful his job is. He sees her as completely absorbed in\\nthe lives of their three children, with little time or attention left for him.\\nAs he became more aware of these thoughts and feelings, Simon started\\nto see similar sentiments toward his children, as well as at work. One\\nday it occurred to him, “Wait a minute—could it really be everyone else\\nor do I have a tendency to feel taken for granted?”\\nSimon was beginning to recognize the existence of a core belief.\\nPsychologist Judith S. Beck (daughter of Dr. Aaron T. Beck) defines core\\nbeliefs as “the most fundamental level of belief; they are global, rigid, andovergeneralized.” In other words, core beliefs form the bedrock of how we\\nsee the world.\\nThe concept of a core belief captures the idea that our negative\\nautomatic thoughts are not random. When we pay attention to what our\\nminds are doing, we’ll find themes that recur again and again. The specific\\nthemes will vary for each of us; our typical responses to triggering\\nsituations will reveal our own core beliefs.\\nA core belief is like a radio station—the songs may differ, but they\\nbelong to the same genre: country, jazz, hip-hop, or classical, for example.\\nWhen you’re tuned to a station, you know what kind of songs to expect. In\\nthe same way, our core beliefs cue up predictable thoughts. For example,\\nSimon’s core belief of being unappreciated triggered negative automatic\\nthoughts about others’ lack of gratitude.\\nBy noticing the “tracks” that your mind often plays, you’ll discover\\nwhat frequency you’re tuned to. With practice, you can develop the ability\\nto change the station.\\nWhy Do We Have Core Beliefs?\\nOur brains have to process an incredible amount of information. Imagine\\nyou’re walking in a big city looking for a restaurant where you’re meeting a\\nfriend. When you enter the restaurant, your senses will be bombarded with\\ncountless stimuli—people standing, others sitting, various rooms, and so\\nforth. If you had to consciously process each stimulus, it would take an\\nenormous amount of time to figure out the setup.\\nFortunately, our minds contain “maps” that help us quickly make sense\\nof the situation, assuming it’s not the first time we’ve been in a restaurant.\\nWe know the person who greets us is the host, so we explain that we’re\\nmeeting a friend who will be joining us shortly. We’re not the least bit\\nsurprised when the host hands us a piece of paper after we sit down, which\\nwe know will list the food items and drinks and the price for each. Our\\nentire meal will unfold in a predictable way, through paying the check and\\nsaying good-bye to the host on the way out.\\nThis example shows that our brains develop shortcuts based on prior\\nlearning. Once we have knowledge about a certain experience, we cannavigate it efficiently. This ability shows that we bring organized\\nknowledge to the experience, relying on an internal model that guides our\\nbehavior.\\nCognitive psychologists call these internal models “schemas” or\\n“scripts.” If you pay attention throughout your day, you’ll notice many such\\nscripts you follow: getting ready for work, making food, driving a car, and\\nchecking out at the grocery store, to name a few. These scripts give rise to\\nautomatic responses that often don’t even require conscious thought, like\\nwhen I drive a car safely even while listening to the radio.\\nIn just the same way, our minds develop mental structures that help us\\ndeal with potentially emotional situations like rejection, success, failure,\\nand so forth. For example, if we experience a small failure, like missing our\\ntrain and being late to a meeting, we might think we’re irresponsible and\\nrespond with feelings of guilt and regret. We might enter the meeting\\ntentatively and with words and a demeanor that suggest not just “I’m sorry”\\nbut also, “I’ve done something bad.” These thoughts, feelings, and\\nbehaviors emanate from the core belief I am inadequate. Being late for the\\nmeeting didn’t cause that belief so much as confirm it: “See, here’s yet\\nanother example of how I’m defective.”\\nMaintaining a different core belief would give rise to a very different\\ncluster of responses. If I believe on a fundamental level that I’m a person of\\nworth, I may see my tardiness as regrettable but not indicative of my overall\\nvalue. I would certainly experience less stress on my commute to work\\nsince my worth as a human being doesn’t hinge on whether I’m on time.\\nEven if my boss pointed out that I’m late, it wouldn’t have a major impact\\non how I felt about myself.\\nSometimes our core beliefs reveal themselves through our assumptions\\nabout how others view us. This process is a type of “projection” because we\\nproject our beliefs about ourselves onto others. For example, if I make a\\nmistake and assume people think I’m a terrible disappointment, it may be\\nthe case that I see myself as a terrible disappointment. Paying attention to\\nwhat you assume others believe to be true about you can help reveal your\\ncore beliefs.Identifying Your Core Beliefs\\nThink about the negative automatic thoughts that often come up for you. Do\\nyou notice any recurrent messages? You might review some of the common\\nthemes that lead to specific emotions and behaviors (e.g., feelings of loss\\nlead to depressive thoughts; chapter 4, here).\\nIf you’ve worked on identifying and changing your automatic thoughts,\\nyou can record those thoughts in the outer ring of the figure displayed here.\\nAs you consider these automatic thoughts, do you find a central belief\\nthat unites them all? If so, write it in the space in the middle. For example:\\nEsther had a lot of anxiety about her health. She completed the core\\nbelief diagram below.When Esther flew on a plane, for example, she interpreted every bump\\nof turbulence as a sign of an imminent crash. We might expect that\\nmany safe landings would weaken her fear of flying since they provide\\nevidence against her fear. However, core beliefs act as a filter that only\\nlets in information that confirms our beliefs. Each time Esther flew, she\\nhad automatic thoughts like “We’re losing altitude!” that made her\\nthink she had narrowly escaped an untimely death. Rather than feeling\\nsafer, she was left with the conviction that she might not be so lucky next\\ntime.\\nAs Esther learned, core beliefs and automatic thoughts act in a self-\\nperpetuating manner, each being the cause and the consequence of the other.\\nAs you become more aware of your own patterns of thinking, be on the\\nlookout for instances when your core beliefs are interfering with an\\nobjective take on reality. This process requires paying close attention for the\\npresence of thinking errors in specific situations, taking care not to believe\\neverything our minds tell us.\\nKeep in mind that negative core beliefs can lie dormant when we’re feeling\\nwell and emerge when we’re gripped by strong emotion. Individuals who\\nare prone to depression are especially likely to show an increase in negative\\nbeliefs when they experience a negative mood, raising the risk for futureepisodes of depression. Thankfully we can train our minds to guard against\\nrelapse, as individuals who have used CBT show a smaller increase in\\nnegative thinking during low moods.\\nYou can also use the downward arrow technique (see chapter 4, here) to\\nget to your core beliefs. At each step, ask yourself what it would mean if\\nyour thought were true.\\nEsther used the downward arrow technique to examine the implications\\nof her automatic thought about having cancer:\\nYou can use the downward arrow technique to explore your own core\\nbeliefs.\\nWhere Do Our Core Beliefs Come From?\\nSome of us may be prone to develop negative core beliefs based simply on\\nthe genes we inherited. A significant part of the tendency to experience\\nnegative emotions—what personality researchers call “neuroticism”—\\ndepends on our genes and research has shown that core beliefs are tied to\\nour levels of neuroticism. It’s unlikely that genetic differences account for\\nthe specific core beliefs we hold. These particular beliefs depend on our life\\nexperiences.\\nSophie constantly battles feelings of being not good enough in some\\nway. She’s had this feeling for as long as she can remember and recalls\\na similar feeling from as early as kindergarten. She had struggled with\\nADHD as a child, and although she was very bright, had been late\\nlearning to read. Her parents had her repeat kindergarten when she\\nmoved school districts to give her a chance to catch up with her peers.\\nSophie’s little sister Claire, in contrast, was reading before age five, and\\nher parents frequently praised Claire for her calm behavior and success\\nin school. As an adult now looking back, Sophie suspects her feelings of\\ninadequacy are based in part on the disappointment she sensed from her\\nparents and her belief that they loved Claire more than they loved her.\\nA single event of parental disapproval or mild teasing is unlikely to\\nleave a lasting mark. However, a general pattern of treatment will probably\\nshape the way individuals view the world and themselves. If the event is\\nsufficiently traumatic, even a single episode can shape our beliefs. For\\nexample, one assault can shift our views on how safe the world is, just as a\\nsingle betrayal can alter our ability to trust others.\\nWe can also develop core beliefs based on things we observed as we\\nwere growing up. For example, if we witnessed our father being constantly\\nstressed out about finances, we may have developed a core belief about\\neconomic scarcity. Or if our mother was continually warning us to becareful, we could develop a core belief about the world as a place of\\nconstant threat.\\nSome of the beliefs we developed earlier in life may have made sense at\\nthe time but are less useful now. For example, a boy who grew up with an\\nabusive parent might have learned that standing up for himself only led to\\nmore abuse. As a result, he developed the core belief I am helpless, which\\nreflected the powerlessness of his situation. Decades later this belief may\\npersist, even though he is no longer a helpless child.\\nTake some time to think about your own history. Are there any events\\nthat stand out as possible contributors to your core beliefs? What were the\\npredominant family dynamics as you were growing up? What were you\\ntaught earlier in life, intentionally or not? And how might these experiences\\nhave affected your views of the world, other people, and yourself? Take\\nsome time to write your thoughts in your journal.\\nBuilding New Core Beliefs\\nOnce you’ve identified your core beliefs and written them down in your\\njournal, how do you go about changing them? Let’s consider several tools\\nyou have at your disposal.\\nSophie recognized that her core belief of being fundamentally flawed\\nwas probably not entirely accurate. Nevertheless, she couldn’t shake the\\nfeeling that it was true. As an experiment, Sophie began to look for data\\nthat could confirm or disconfirm her negative view of herself. Treating it\\nas an experiment stoked her curiosity—could it be that she’d been\\nmaking a false assumption all these years?\\nREVIEWING YOUR HIST ORY\\nSophie began by reviewing some of her past experiences and was\\nsurprised to find at least as much evidence for her strengths as for her\\nflaws. For example, she had managed to get into a good college (even\\nthough her high school grades were not stellar) and had graduated\\nmagna cum laude.Sophie found herself discounting her strong college performance by\\ntelling herself she did well “only because I worked so hard.” When she\\ncaught herself using the old negative filter, she realized she’d identified\\nanother strength—she was a hard worker.\\nThink back on your own life history. What evidence supports your core\\nbeliefs? Is there evidence that contradicts it? Record your responses in the\\nform. Take care to notice if your core belief might be biasing your memory\\nor your interpretation of events. For example, is a core belief about being a\\nfailure making you interpret disappointments as being entirely your fault?\\nAs much as possible, make this exercise a fair test of your belief.\\nAs you look over your completed form, can you draw any conclusions\\nabout the accuracy of your core belief? Was it based on any thinking errors,\\nsuch as black-and-white thinking (see here)?\\nCore Belief: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n-------------------------------\\nEvidence supporting belief: Evidence contradicting belief:\\n----------------------------------- -----------------------------------\\n----------------------------------- -----------------------------------\\n----------------------------------- -----------------------------------\\n----------------------------------- -----------------------------------\\nAccuracy of my core belief:\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n--------------------------------------------\\nAlternative belief:\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYou can find a copy of this form online at CallistoMediaBooks.com/CBTMadeSimple.\\nAs with automatic thoughts, see if you can identify a more realistic\\nbelief. There’s no need to overcompensate and come up with an extremely\\npositive belief like I’m incredibly competent, which may not be based in\\nfact and will be hard to believe. Sophie came up with I have many\\nstrengths, which to her seemed not only positive but reasonable.\\nAlso, don’t worry if you have a hard time feeling like your alternative\\nbelief is true. Negative core beliefs can be persistent, and modifying them\\ntakes time and repetition.\\nTESTING CURRENT EVIDENCE\\nWe can do a similar test of our negative core belief in the present. Using the\\nsame form, you can keep track of the evidence for and against your belief\\nduring a day. Look over your sheet at the end of the day and examine the\\ndata—how strong is the case for your belief? As always, you don’t have to\\nforce yourself to believe anything. It will take time to train your thoughts in\\na new direction.\\n“CYCLING THE PUCK” IN CBT\\nWhen I was first learning about CBT, my supervisor was psychologist\\nDr. Rob DeRubeis, whose seminal work showed that CBT and\\nmedication were equally effective in treating depression (you might\\nrecognize his name from the foreword to this book). Dr. DeRubeis gave\\nus a metaphor for how thoughts change in CBT that he called “cycling\\nthe puck.” Hockey players cycle the puck—keep passing to one another\\nwhile staying in motion—in the offensive zone when they are looking\\nfor an opening to score.\\nThe “puck” in CBT is evidence against our core belief, and we cycle the\\npuck by repeatedly considering information that shows our core belief is\\nnot true. Scoring a goal means the mind absorbs that evidence and altersits core belief. You’ll know the evidence hits home when something\\nclicks mentally, which might feel like an aha moment.\\nThese moments are linked to what Dr. DeRubeis and his colleagues\\nidentified as “sudden gains” in CBT, in which depression symptoms\\nshow a quick drop in severity. These sudden gains are also linked to a\\nlower likelihood of relapse in the future, suggesting that the cognitive\\nchange has a protective effect.\\nPRACTICING THE POSITIVE\\nThe negative core beliefs we identify have had countless opportunities to\\ncolor our thoughts, feelings, and actions. Changing them will take persistent\\npractice, not only in testing their accuracy but also in learning new ways to\\nthink. If we only contradict our old beliefs, what replaces them? We need to\\npractice new ways of thinking that will support healthier core beliefs.\\nLead with the positive\\nWhen we begin to learn how our minds react in certain situations, we can\\npredict our automatic thoughts.\\nWendy often gives presentations as part of her job and has recognized\\nthat she always expects the audience to think poorly of her. She\\nidentified her core belief as “I’m unlikable,” which acts as a filter when\\nshe presents. Her mind interprets every subtle movement by audience\\nmembers as evidence that they dislike her. For example, when someone\\nfolds their arms, she assumes they’re getting impatient with her.\\nOnce Wendy knows what her mind will do when she presents, she\\ndoesn’t have to wait until her negative automatic thoughts show\\nthemselves. Instead she can dictate her response with careful planning.\\nWendy completed the form below before she gave a presentation.\\nSituation:  Giving a presentation\\nRelevant Cor e Belief:  I’m unlikable\\nMore Realistic Cor e Belief:  Most people who know me really seem to like me.\\nLIKEL Y AUT OMA TIC THOUGHTS RATIONAL RESPONSEThey’re bored.Participants consistently rate my presentations\\nas interesting.\\nThey can tell I know nothing about this topic.

My boss thinks I’m the best presenter in our\\ndivision.\\nThey’re learning nothing.People often tell me how much they learned\\nfrom my talks.\\nYou can find a copy of this form online at CallistoMediaBooks.com/CBTMadeSimple .\\nBefore Wendy gave her last presentation, she reviewed the sheet she’d\\nfilled out. She reminded herself of her alternative core belief and read\\nthe rational responses to her negative automatic thoughts, pausing after\\neach one to give herself a moment to connect with these accurate\\nobservations. As she started to present, she focused on the “plus\\ncolumn,” that she gives strong, informative presentations that people\\nenjoy. She also reminded herself not to buy into her core belief if it\\nreared its head.\\nYou can use the form that Wendy used to practice thought patterns that\\nserve you well. Keep in mind that you’ll be crafting much more than\\ngeneric positive affirmations. You’ll be generating thoughts specifically\\ntailored to the problematic patterns that have plagued you.\\nIt’s especially hard to come up with evidence that contradicts our\\nnegative core belief when we most need it—when our negative beliefs are\\nactivated and we’re being bombarded with negative automatic thoughts. For\\nthis reason, it’s important to write down the plan for dealing with your\\nanticipated thoughts. It may be most convenient to write your plan on an\\nindex card or, as Dr. Judith Beck calls it, a “coping card.”\\nBefore you enter a challenging situation, review the evidence for the\\nmore realistic core belief. You can even rehearse these more accurate ways\\nof thinking when you wake up in the morning and when you lie down to\\nsleep at night—two occasions when our minds can dwell on negativeautomatic thoughts. This proactive approach is an alternative to always\\nplaying defense and can be an effective means of chipping away at core\\nbeliefs rather than reinforcing them.\\nKeep a r ecord of things that went well\\nMany studies have shown the benefits of taking stock of positive events in\\nour lives. The practice is simply to write down at the end of each day three\\nthings that went well. Next, write down why they went well: sheer luck?\\nSomething you did? Something another person did? Consistently\\ncompleting this exercise leads to greater happiness and less depression.\\nIt also presents many opportunities to find evidence against your\\nnegative core belief. For example, a woman who believes I never do\\nanything right may discover that she successfully resolved a difficult work\\nissue, which contradicts her core belief.\\nBrush your shoulders off\\nOnce we’ve identified our negative core belief we’ll have a pretty good idea\\nof the types of thoughts it will send our way. With practice, we can take our\\nnegative automatic thoughts less seriously. Initially, it’s essential to delve\\ninto the thoughts, write them down, look for evidence, and so forth—the\\nfull approach we covered in chapter 4.\\nAnd then we reach a point at which we know with confidence that the\\nautomatic thoughts aren’t telling the truth. At that point, we can shift to\\nquickly dismissing the thoughts; in effect, giving them the minimal\\nattention they deserve.\\nMost people find it’s helpful to have a set phrase that signals the brush-\\noff to the automatic thoughts. Here are some examples to give you a feel for\\nit. It’s important to have one that fits your own voice and style:\\n•Oh, you again?\\n•Ha, good one.\\n•Oh, no, you don’t.\\n•I’m not falling for that.•What a silly thought!\\n•Funny that I actually used to believe that.\\nOne caveat: be careful not to adopt a phrase that feels self-critical. We don’t\\nwant to make this exercise feel punishing.\\nAs we start taking negative thoughts less seriously, we begin to develop\\na different relationship with our thoughts. The next chapter expands on that\\nnotion as we learn about the principles and practices of mindfulness.\\nChapter Summary and Homework\\nIn this chapter, we built on the practices from chapter 4 as we identified and\\nchallenged core beliefs. We saw how these beliefs do double duty, as they\\nnot only lead to negative automatic thoughts but also create a mental filter\\nthat can interfere with our ability to evaluate those automatic thoughts\\nobjectively. It’s not easy to alter our core beliefs, and doing so takes\\npersistent practice. Plan to be patient with yourself as you modify these\\ndeeply held beliefs.\\nThe homework for this chapter includes multiple techniques for\\nidentifying and changing your core beliefs:\\n1Note recurrent themes in your negative automatic thoughts.\\n2Use the downward arrow technique to explore the meaning of your\\nautomatic thoughts.\\n3Review aspects of your past that may have shaped your core beliefs.\\n4Test past and current evidence that may or may not support your core\\nbeliefs.\\n5Practice leading with the positive in situations that are likely to trigger\\nautomatic thoughts related to your core beliefs.\\n6Keep a daily record of three things that went well, and why.\\n7And finally, over time you can shift toward simply shrugging off\\ninaccurate thoughts and continuing on your way.CHAPTER SIX\\nMaintain Mindfulness\\nIn this chapter we dive into mindfulness, the “third wave” in CBT alongside\\ncognitive and behavioral practices. Mindfulness has emerged in the past few\\ndecades as a powerful way to maintain our equilibrium as we deal with\\ndifficult emotions.\\nMatt didn’t know how much more of this he could take. For the past few\\nnights he’d been working to transition his infant daughter to falling\\nasleep in her crib rather than while being rocked, and it wasn’t going as\\nsmoothly as he’d hoped.\\n“She should be asleep by now,” he thought to himself as his daughter\\ncontinued to babble away. He had gone into her room once already to\\nresettle her and thought she was close to drifting off when he left. But a\\nminute later he heard her very awake-sounding voice through the baby\\nmonitor. A few minutes later her babbles turned to crying. Matt knew\\nhe’d have to settle her again.\\nHe shook his head as he entered her room, hoping she couldn’t sense his\\nirritation. He looked forward to finally getting to watch his TV show in\\npeace as he patted her back, rolling his eyes and gritting his teeth in the\\ndarkness.\\nWhat Is Mindfulness?\\nIf you pay attention to what your mind is doing, you’ll notice two strong\\ntendencies:\\n1The mind focuses on things other than what is happening right now.\\nMost of the time we’re thinking about events that have already happened\\nor that might happen in the future. Thus our well-being is often affected\\nby things that have little to do with the moment in which we find\\nourselves.2The mind continually evaluates our reality as good or bad. It does so\\nbased on whether things are working out the way we want them to. We\\ntry to cling to circumstances we like and push away those we dislike.\\nThese tendencies are part of what it means to be human. They can also\\ncause us problems and needless suffering. Focusing on the future can lead\\nto worry and anxiety, most often about things that will never happen.\\nRuminating on events from the past can lead to distress and regret about\\nthings that are no longer in our control.\\nIn the process, we miss the once-in-a-lifetime experience that each\\nmoment offers. We don’t really take in the people around us, the natural\\nbeauty of our surroundings, or the sights, sounds, and other sensations that\\nare here right now.\\nOur constant and automatic effort to judge things as either for us or\\nagainst us also creates unnecessary pain. We often end up resisting things\\nwe don’t like, even when such resistance is futile. A perfect example is\\nraging against the weather—no amount of cursing the rain will make it stop,\\nand we’ll only frustrate ourselves in the process.\\nThe practice of mindfulness offers an antidote to both of these habits.\\nPRESENCE\\nMindfulness is as simple as bringing our awareness to the present. That’s it.\\nIf you’re walking the dog, pay attention to that experience. If you’re having\\nlunch, focus on having lunch. If you’re arguing with your partner or\\nembracing afterward, be fully in that experience.\\nSometimes when we learn what mindfulness is we say, “I already know\\nthat I’m walking the dog. I know I’m having lunch. How is that supposed to\\nbe helpful?” But mindfulness is more than knowing that we’re doing\\nsomething. It’s about going deeper, intentionally cultivating a connection\\nwith our experience. We don’t just walk the dog—we notice the color of the\\nsky, the feel of the ground under our feet, the sounds our dog makes, the\\nperiodic pulls on the leash. It’s opening our awareness to elements of our\\nexperience that we normally miss.At the same time, a mindful approach doesn’t require that we do\\nanything in addition to what we’re engaging in. If we’re running, we’re\\nrunning. If we’re driving, we’re driving. People sometimes protest that\\nbeing mindful in certain situations would be distracting, even dangerous. In\\nfact, the opposite is true—we’re safer and less distracted when our attention\\nis fixed on what we’re doing.\\nSimply being present in our lives accomplishes two things at once. First,\\nit allows us to get more out of what’s happening, so we don’t sleepwalk\\nthrough our lives. We can discover the richness in our reality, even in the\\nmost mundane activities. Second, when we’re present, we’re not ruminating\\nabout the past or fearing the future, which is a big part of why mindfulness\\npractice reduces anxiety and depression.\\nSo much of our unhappiness arises from things that have nothing to do\\nwith what’s real in this moment. For example, I was walking home from the\\ntrain one evening and started thinking about my children’s health. Before I\\nknew it, I was imagining a tragic scenario in which one of them was gravely\\nsick, and I began to feel anxious and downcast as though it were already\\nhappening. When I caught myself and came back to the present, I noticed\\nwhat was real: the lengthening light, the birds flying, the green grass, and\\nblue sky. My kids were healthy as far as I knew. I didn’t have to live in my\\ntragic fantasy. It was hard not to smile with that realization as I headed\\nhome to see them.\\n“The way to experience nowness is to realize that this very moment, this\\nvery point in your life, is always the occasion.” —Chögyam Trungpa,\\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior\\nACCEPT ANCE\\nThe second core feature of mindful awareness is acceptance, which means\\nopening to our experience as it unfolds.\\nAfter a couple miserable nights, Matt realized he needed a new\\nperspective on his daughter’s bedtime. The next night he decided to try a\\ndifferent approach—what if he let the night play out however it was\\ngoing to? It’s not like his resistance made things better: it was makinghim frustrated toward his baby every night. He resolved to do his best to\\nhelp her fall asleep, and to release his fierce attachment to controlling\\nexactly when that happened.\\nThe first time his daughter began to cry, Matt took a calming breath\\nbefore going in to her room. Instead of telling himself, “I hate this,” or,\\n“This is ridiculous,” he thought, “This is what’s happening right now.”\\nThen he took stock of what that statement actually meant: He was\\nstanding by the crib of his baby girl, whom he loved more than words.\\nHe was patting her tiny back, which was the size of his hand. He could\\nhear her breathing begin to slow. He realized how in that moment he\\nhad no real complaint about anything. He wasn’t cold, hungry, thirsty,\\nor in danger. His daughter was healthy. She just wasn’t asleep yet.\\nMaybe things were exactly as they ought to be.\\nMatt’s example reveals important corollaries of mindful acceptance.\\nFirst, it doesn’t mean we stop having preferences for how things go. Of\\ncourse, Matt still wanted his baby to fall asleep quickly and easily, and\\nwanted to have more of the evening to himself to unwind. Accepting meant\\nholding those preferences more lightly, and not assuming his daughter was\\ndoing something wrong by not being asleep when he wanted her to be.\\nAccordingly, Matt didn’t throw in the towel and stop following the\\nbedtime routine he and his wife had agreed on to transition their baby to\\nfalling asleep on her own in her crib. He stuck to his plan, offering\\npredictability and consistency while recognizing that he couldn’t control his\\ndaughter’s sleep.\\nWhen we stop fighting against the way things are, we relieve an\\nenormous portion of our stress. Earlier in my career I had a very difficult\\nsupervisor, and I often found myself tied up in my thoughts as I tried to\\nmake sense of how unreasonable she was. Finally, I reached a point of\\naccepting that she could just be difficult, period. My acceptance didn’t\\nchange her behavior, but it did free me from acting as if she were doing\\nsomething surprising. She was simply being true to form.\\nA crucial part of acceptance is that it lets us respond appropriately to the\\nfacts in front of us. My acceptance of my boss’s temperament made it clearto me that I needed to find work elsewhere, which underscores the\\ndistinction between acceptance and apathy.\\nBenefits of Mindfulness\\nTraining in mindfulness helps with a wide range of conditions. A partial list\\nincludes anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic\\npain, depression, eating disorders, excessive anger, insomnia, obsessive-\\ncompulsive disorder (OCD), relationship difficulties, smoking cessation,\\nand stress. Many treatment programs have been developed that integrate\\nmindfulness practices into CBT. One of the first was mindfulness-based\\ncognitive therapy (MBCT) for depression, developed by psychologists\\nZindel Segal, John Teasdale, and Mark Williams. These developers\\nreasoned that the tools of mindfulness were well suited to remedy some of\\nthe factors that contribute to depression. For example, practicing paying\\nattention to one’s internal experience could strengthen one’s ability to detect\\nearly warning signs of depression, like unrealistic negative automatic\\nthoughts.\\nMBCT includes elements of traditional CBT for depression and\\nintegrates training in mindfulness to protect against relapse. Much of the\\ntraining focuses on using mindful awareness to notice problematic thoughts.\\nIt also emphasizes learning a different relationship with our thoughts. We\\ncan learn to recognize them as simply thoughts rather than something we\\nneed to react to.\\nMultiple studies have shown that MBCT achieves this aim. For\\nexample, a study by Teasdale, Segal, Williams, and their colleagues found\\nthat among individuals with recurrent depression, MBCT reduced the risk\\nfor relapse by nearly half versus the comparison group that received\\ntreatments other than MBCT (e.g., antidepressant medication, other types of\\npsychotherapy).\\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), developed by Steven\\nHayes, has also received strong research support for treating several\\nconditions like depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. As the name suggests,\\nit emphasizes acceptance of our experience in the service of committing to\\naction that supports our values. Closely related to ACT is Acceptance-Based Behavioral Therapy, designed by Susan Orsillo and Lizabeth Roemer\\nto treat generalized anxiety disorder. And the best-tested treatment for\\nborderline personality disorder—a debilitating and difficult-to-treat\\ncondition—includes a strong mindfulness component to address the\\ndifficulty handling the strong emotion that is part of this diagnosis.\\nMindfulness clearly has beneficial effects on many psychological issues.\\nHow does this approach lead to improvements?\\nHOW MINDFULNESS HELPS\\nThere are several ways in which mindfulness practice produces its benefits:\\nGreater awareness of our thoughts and emotions. When we practice\\npaying attention more and opening to our reality, we begin to know\\nourselves better. We give ourselves the space required to recognize how\\nwe’re thinking and feeling and, because we accept reality as it is, we don’t\\ndeny our own experience.\\nBetter control of our emotions. Greater awareness of our internal\\nexperiences helps us interrupt unhelpful trains of thought like rumination\\nand resentment. Adopting a present focus also tends to be calming, which\\ncan loosen the grip of runaway emotions.\\nA different relationship with our thoughts. Our minds are continuously\\ngenerating thoughts. As we allow these thoughts to come and go during\\nmindfulness practice, we start to give less weight to them. We learn that\\nthey are simply ideas created by our minds, and not necessarily a reflection\\nof anything meaningful.\\nDecreased reactivity. As our relationship with our thoughts evolves, we\\nbecome less prone to habitual reactions, which are often not in our best\\ninterest. Mindfulness can provide a pause before we act on our initial\\nimpulse, giving us enough time to choose a response that fits our goals and\\nvalues.\\nHow Can We Practice Mindfulness?Like any habit, being more mindful takes practice. There are two major\\ncategories of mindfulness practice: activities designed specifically to\\nengage mindful awareness and bringing mindfulness to our ordinary life\\nactivities.\\nFORMAL MINDFULNESS PRACTICES\\nThe most common formal mindfulness technique is sitting meditation. It\\ninvolves choosing something to focus on for a set amount of time and\\nopening to the experience as it unfolds moment by moment. The most\\ncommon target of focus is our breath, which is always with us and always\\nhappening in the present. Inevitably our attention will drift to other times\\nand places, or we’ll start engaging in judgments of how we’re doing or\\nwhether we like meditating. The practice is simply to return to our intended\\nfocus once we realize we’ve lost it. This focus on coming back to our\\npresent moment, without criticizing our minds for wandering, is the essence\\nof meditation.\\nOther common types of meditation can entail a focus on bodily\\nsensations (body scan meditation), ambient sounds, or wishes of health and\\ncontentment toward ourselves and others (loving-kindness meditation).\\nFormal practices also include more active exercises like yoga and tai\\nchi. In yoga, for example, we can pay attention to the physical sensations of\\nthe poses, including the breath that’s synchronized with our movement. We\\ncan also practice acceptance of the discomfort we sometimes feel in\\nchallenging postures, which can lead to either staying in the pose and\\nbreathing with the discomfort or changing our position if necessary.\\nAwareness and acceptance promote choice.\\n“One of the main discoveries of meditation is seeing how we continually\\nrun away from the present moment, how we avoid being here just as we are.\\nThat’s not considered to be a problem; the point is to see it.” —Pema\\nChödrön, The Wisdom of No Escape and the Path of Loving-Kindness\\nHow to Start MeditatingThe idea of meditation is simple, but the practice of it typically is not easy.\\nWhen we sit down to meditate, the mind often decides it has other things to\\ndo. Common reactions when we start to meditate include:\\n•Feeling a bit bored\\n•Feeling frustrated\\n•Wanting to stop\\n•Suddenly remembering things you’ve been meaning to do\\n•Having countless thoughts clamoring for your attention\\nNone of these experiences means you’re doing something wrong or can’t\\nmeditate, so stick with it. It can help to keep the following things in mind\\nfor your meditation practice:\\nYou’re not bad at meditating. We’ll lose our focus again and again while\\nwe meditate. If you think you’re bad at it, think again—meditation is simply\\nrefinding our focus as many times as we lose it. We don’t have to buy into\\nthe self-critical thoughts that intrude into our meditation sessions.\\nThe goal is not to “become good at meditating.” It’s easy to bring the\\nhabit of judging to our mindfulness practice, which can make meditation\\nboth punishing and disappointing. The point of meditation is simply to\\nfocus on the present and to let go of judgments.\\nLet go of attachment to a specific outcome. You probably have\\nexpectations of what meditation will be like—having a clear and settled\\nmind, for example—and could strive to make the experience match what\\nyou expect. But in reality, we never know what we’ll experience during\\nmeditation. We can practice opening to whatever happens in a particular\\nsession.\\nThere are many ways to meditate. Here’s a simple plan to get started:\\n1Practice meditation when you’re able to stay awake and alert.\\n2Find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed, and remove possible\\ndistractions like your phone.3Choose a comfortable seat on the floor, in a chair, or anywhere else. If\\nyou sit on the floor, you can raise your hips with a blanket or a yoga\\nblock if that’s more comfortable.\\n4Close your eyes if you wish, or keep them open and fixed on the floor a\\nfew feet in front of you.\\n5Practice with or without a recording; set a timer if you do it without.\\nFive minutes is a good starting point. Keep the timer out of sight.\\n6Begin to notice the sensations of breathing, paying attention to them for\\nthe full length of your inhalation and exhalation.\\n7Bring your attention back to the breath each time you realize your mind\\nhas wandered.\\n8There are many apps and free online meditations available if you prefer\\na guided meditation. Aura and Insight Timer, for example, are free\\nmeditation apps available for iOS and Android systems.\\nFinally, as with anything else, maintain a light touch. Meditation\\npractice is for you, so beware of making it yet another chore to cross off\\nyour list.\\nMindfulness in Action\\nThe other category of mindfulness practice happens in the course of our\\neveryday activities. Matt used exactly this approach to change his troubled\\nrelationship with his daughter’s bedtime. We can bring our attention to\\nwhatever we’re doing, opening to the experience as much as possible.\\nBen loves to cycle around where he lives. It’s a very hilly area, so most\\nof the time he’s either going up or down a big hill. He realized at some\\npoint that he was spending much of his rides hating the inclines,\\nworrying he’d be unable to reach the top of one of the next summits.\\nThis had never happened in the 10 years he’d been cycling. He\\nestimated that he spent about half of his time in the saddle preoccupied\\nby the more difficult parts of his rides, which detracted from his\\nenjoyment of the easier parts.The next time Ben was on his bike, he decided to focus his attention on\\neach part of the ride and develop an interest in the experience rather\\nthan resisting it. As he rode, he found he could appreciate the easy parts\\nof the ride more because he wasn’t dreading the next hill, and he could\\nallow the climbs to be difficult and challenging but not something to\\nresist. He continued to have anxious thoughts about not being able to\\nmake it to the top of a hill but was able to take those thoughts less\\nseriously, recognizing them as just thoughts and not accurate\\npredictions.\\nAs you’re practicing mindful awareness in your own daily activities,\\nkeep the following principles in mind:\\n1Focus your attention on your sensory experiences (sights, sounds, etc.)\\nas well as your thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations.\\n2Open to what is happening in the moment, allowing your experience to\\nbe as it is rather than resisting.\\n3Bring a “beginner’s mind” to the activity, as though it’s the first time\\nyou’ve ever done or witnessed it. Let go of preconceived expectations of\\nhow it will be.\\n4Allow the experience to take as long as it takes, rather than trying to\\nrush through it to the next thing.\\n5Notice the urge to grab on to aspects of the experience you like and push\\naway the parts you don’t.\\n6Allow thoughts to come and go, recognizing that they are just thoughts.\\nPractice neither getting lost in the thoughts nor resisting them, but\\nsimply letting them flow.\\nBRINGING MINDFUL AWARENESS TO\\nYOUR DAILY ROUTINES\\nWe can focus our attention on anything we’re doing. Here are some\\nexamples from our everyday activities:Taking a shower. There are many sensory experiences to pay attention\\nto in the shower, like the feeling of the water on your body, the sound of\\nthe water, the warmth and wetness of the air, the sensation of your feet\\non the stall or tub, and the smell of the soap or shampoo.\\nDaily grooming. Activities like shaving, combing your hair, or brushing\\nyour teeth can feel like tedious chores. But if you’ve ever been unable to\\ndo one of these things, like brushing your teeth after oral surgery, you\\nknow the delight you feel to finally do them again. Practice taking your\\ntime and doing the activity as if for the very first time.\\nBeing outdoors. Pretend (or realize) you’re a visitor on planet Earth.\\nSee the sky, feel the air, hear the birds, and witness the trees as if you’ve\\nnever before experienced this strange and awe-inspiring place.\\nEating. Notice the food you’re eating—its color and aroma, its taste and\\ntexture in your mouth, the sensation of chewing and swallowing. Savor\\nthe experience as though you’ve never eaten before.\\nReading a book. Notice the feel and smell of the book, its weight, the\\ntexture of the pages and their sound as they turn. Be aware of the feeling\\nyou have as you settle into a book.\\nListening to someone. Notice the person’s eyes as he or she speaks, the\\nintonation of his or her voice, the variation in emotion. Practice hearing\\nand seeing this person as if for the first time.\\nGoing to bed. We can end our day by letting go of our past experiences\\nwith sleep and opening to whatever this night will bring. Feel your body\\npressing down into the mattress, and the mattress pressing up to support\\nyou. Pay attention to the sensations of your head on the pillow, the\\nblanket or sheet on top of you, sounds in the room and outside of it, the\\nbreath moving in and out of your body.\\nMindfulness Myths\\nMany people have objections to the idea of mindfulness when they first\\nlearn about it, and these objections can prevent a person from engaging inthe practice. Most of these objections seem to come from\\nmisunderstandings about what it means to be mindful. Common myths\\ninclude:\\nMindfulness is a religious or cultish practice. Because mindfulness is an\\nintegral part of some religious traditions, we might assume it’s an inherently\\nreligious activity. However, being in our lives and actually doing what\\nwe’re doing doesn’t belong to any particular religious or spiritual approach,\\nand can be practiced without adherence to any religious tradition (including\\nmystical or New Age spirituality). Still, mindfulness is not contradictory to\\nreligion. Whatever our beliefs and values, we can embrace them more\\ncompletely through a mindful approach.\\nMindfulness is unscientific. People sometimes object to the concept of\\nmindfulness because they “prefer to live in the realm of fact and science.” If\\nyou need solid evidence for the benefits of mindfulness, you’re in luck—a\\nlarge and growing number of rigorous studies have found that mindfulness\\nhelps with a wide range of conditions like anxiety and depression. It has\\neven been found to change the brain. Mindfulness practice is supported by\\nsolid science.\\nMindfulness means spending a lot of time in our heads. Language is an\\nimperfect tool, and it’s easy to misunderstand what “mindfulness” refers to.\\nRather than dwelling in our minds, mindfulness is about connecting with\\nour basic experiences and letting go of the stories we wrap them in. To be\\nmindful is to be aware and in a state of openness to what we discover.\\nMindfulness means giving up any efforts to affect our world for the\\nbetter. The word acceptance can mean we’re not going to try to change\\nsomething, like when we say, “I’ve accepted that I’m not going to play\\nprofessional sports.” In the context of mindfulness, acceptance means we\\ndon’t deny that reality is reality. We’re willing to see a situation the way it\\nis. This kind of acceptance can actually be the catalyst for change, as when\\nwe accept that there is crushing poverty in our community and decide to\\ntake action to ameliorate it.Mindfulness is weakness. If we assume mindfulness means never taking a\\nstand, it would follow that mindfulness is a sort of milquetoast practice—\\nespecially if we equate fighting and resistance with strength. But on the\\ncontrary, letting go is difficult. It takes hard work and determination to let\\ngo of our habits of perseverating on the past and fearing the future.\\nMindfulness helps us direct our strength in ways that serve us.\\nMindfulness means never having goals. If we’re focused on the present\\nand practicing acceptance, how can we set goals or plan for the future? It\\nmight seem paradoxical, but planning for the future and setting goals are\\ncompletely compatible with mindfulness practice. As noted previously,\\naccepting reality can give rise to efforts to change a situation. For example,\\nI might accept that my house is too hot and decide to buy an air conditioner.\\nAnd we can practice presence even while setting goals or making plans,\\nbeing immersed in the reality of those forward-looking activities.\\nMindfulness equals meditation. The word mindfulness often conjures up\\nimages of someone sitting cross-legged and meditating, which makes sense\\nas meditation is a very common mindfulness practice. But meditation is not\\nthe only way to practice being mindful. An infinite number of activities\\noffer opportunities to develop openness to our experience, from relaxing\\nwith friends to running an ultra-marathon. The advantage of formal practice\\nlike meditation is that it offers a concentrated dose of training the mind to\\nfocus on the now. We can then bring that training into any moment of our\\nlives. Indeed, I’ve found that practicing meditation leads to more\\nexperiences of spontaneous mindful presence in our day-to-day activities.\\nMINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS\\nREDUCTION (MBSR)\\nYou don’t have to be dealing with a psychological disorder to benefit\\nfrom training in mindfulness. Most of us would be well served by tools\\nto deal with the ordinary stresses of being alive. Jon Kabat-Zinn\\ndeveloped a well-known eight-week program called MBSR, which\\nthousands of people have completed. It includes:•Education about the principles of mindfulness\\n•Training in meditation\\n•Mindful awareness of the body\\n•Gentle yoga\\n•Mindfulness in activities\\nThe MBSR program is a reliable way to reduce anxiety and increase\\none’s ability to manage stress. If you’re interested in learning more, Dr.\\nKabat-Zinn details the program in his book Full Catastrophe Living.\\nYou can also check online for MBSR or mindfulness-based courses near\\nyou.\\nMINDFUL WALKING\\nIf you’re ready to put mindfulness into action, an easy way to get started\\nis to go for a mindful walk. In this exercise you’ll practice bringing to\\nyour experience greater attention and curiosity than usual. You might\\nchoose to notice:\\n•The solidness of the ground beneath your feet\\n•The movements and muscle contractions required to balance and\\nwalk: the swing of your arms, the push-off of each foot, the\\ncontractions in your leg muscles and lower back, etc.\\n•Sounds you’re creating, like your breath and your footfalls\\n•Surrounding sounds, like birds, cars, and the wind through the trees\\n•The sights around you, including things you might have passed\\ncountless times but never really noticed\\n•Smells in the air\\n•The sensation of air on your skin and the warmth of the sun\\n•The quality of the light—its angle, intensity, the colors it creates\\n•The particularities of the sky above you\\nThis approach can be applied to any experience you choose, from the\\nmost mundane to the most sublime.Chapter Summary and Homework\\nIn this chapter, we explored the powerful and far-reaching effects of simply\\nbeing fully in our experience with greater openness. Formal practices like\\nyoga and meditation complement moments of mindfulness in our everyday\\nactivities. We also saw how these practices have been integrated with CBT\\nand shown to effectively treat many conditions. If you’re working on\\nbehavioral activation and/or changing your thoughts, mindfulness principles\\ndovetail perfectly with those practices. Subsequent chapters will include\\npractices from all three pillars of CBT.\\nIt’s normal to have misgivings about mindfulness, which often are based\\non false impressions of what the practice is about. If you’re ready to try\\nmindfulness for the first time or want to deepen your practice, I invite you\\nto take the following steps:\\n1Begin to notice what your mind is up to during your day. Is it focused on\\nthe past, the present, the future? Is it opening to your experience or\\nresisting? Take care to just notice, letting go as much as possible of\\njudging what your mind is doing.\\n2Choose a small number of activities to practice mindful awareness\\nduring your day, using the six principles presented in this chapter.\\n3Begin a meditation practice. If meditation is brand new to you, start with\\njust a few minutes a day. The Resources section at the back of this book\\nprovides links to free guided meditations.\\n4Reading books on mindfulness can reinforce the concepts from this\\nchapter and contribute to a robust practice; check the Resources section\\nfor suggestions to get you started.\\n5Practice incorporating the principles of mindfulness into behavioral\\nactivation and retraining your thoughts. For example, bring enhanced\\nawareness to your planned activities to maximize the enjoyment and\\nsense of accomplishment.CHAPTER SEVEN\\nStay on Task: Push Through Procrastination\\nIn this chapter, we’ll address why we often delay doing what we know we\\nhave to do. As we’ll see, there are several factors that lead us to\\nprocrastinate. Once we understand these factors, we’ll consider the many\\ntools that CBT offers for breaking this habit.\\nAlec knew he needed to start on his final paper, which was due the next\\nday at 5 p.m. “I’ve still got 24 hours,” he thought to himself as he\\nlooked at the stack of books he was going to use as references. He felt\\nhis stomach tighten with a surge of anxiety as he wondered how the\\npaper would turn out. Just then another video autoplayed on his\\ncomputer from the “Top Ten Funniest Pet Videos” playlist. “I’ll just\\nwatch this one. Maybe one more after this one,” he said to himself as he\\nturned back to his laptop, feeling vaguely guilty but temporarily\\nrelieved.\\nDo You Have a Procrastination Problem?\\nPeople vary in their tendency to procrastinate and in the specific tasks they\\nput off doing. Take some time to consider ways you might delay doing\\nthings you know you need to do. Do you find yourself in any of the\\nfollowing situations on a regular basis due to procrastination?\\n•Realizing you didn’t leave yourself enough time to finish a task by the\\ndeadline.\\n•Feeling inadequately prepared for meetings.\\n•Trying to force yourself to do a task.\\n•Being stressed about time as you rush to appointments.\\n•Trying to hide that you haven’t been working on a task.\\n•Producing lower quality work than you’re capable of.\\n•Telling yourself, “I’ll take care of that later.”•Waiting to feel more inspired or motivated so you can do a task.\\n•Finding ways to waste time instead of doing what you need to do.\\n•Relying on last-minute pressure to complete a task.\\nLet’s begin by considering why we procrastinate and then turn to ways\\nto overcome it.\\nWhat Drives Procrastination?\\nWe’ve all been there—a paper to write, an errand to run, a home project to\\nstart, or any number of other tasks we put off. Little good seems to come\\nfrom these delays—for example, procrastination is associated with worse\\nacademic performance and greater sickness. Nevertheless, we often struggle\\nto take care of things in a timely way. The following factors contribute to\\nour tendency to procrastinate:\\nFear that it will be unpleasant. When we think about doing a task, our\\nminds often go automatically to the most unenjoyable parts of it. If we\\nimagine cleaning the gutters, we think about wrestling with the ladder.\\nWhen we consider writing a paper, we dwell on the struggle we’ll have at\\ntimes to express our ideas clearly. The more we imagine these negative\\naspects, the less incentive we have to get started.\\nFear of not doing a good job. We rarely know for sure how something we\\nwork on will turn out, and that uncertainty can give rise to fear of doing it\\nbadly. For example, when Alec considered writing his paper, he worried\\nthat he would have nothing intelligent to say. This fear of possibly\\ndisappointing ourselves or others can prevent us from getting started.\\nPermission-giving thoughts. Sometimes we tell ourselves we deserve a\\nbreak or convince ourselves we’ll work better at some point in the future. In\\none way or another we justify our procrastination. There are times when\\nthese kinds of thoughts make sense—for example, sometimes taking a\\nbreak really is the best course of action for us. But often these self-\\nstatements drive unhealthy habits of avoidance.Negative reinforcement. Every time we put off a task we think will be\\nunpleasant, we experience a feeling of relief. The brain interprets that relief\\nas a reward, and we’re more likely to repeat an action that led to reward. In\\nthis way, our procrastination is reinforced. Psychologists call it “negative\\nreinforcement” because it comes about through taking away something seen\\nas aversive. In contrast, positive reinforcement is when getting something\\nwe like strengthens a behavior—for example, receiving a paycheck\\nreinforces the behavior of doing our job. The negative reinforcement from\\navoiding a task can be very difficult to overcome.\\nIs there any task you’ve been meaning to get to and keep putting off, or\\nthat you routinely delay doing? Which of these factors applies to your own\\nprocrastination tendencies? In your notebook or journal, write down any\\nways in which you’ve been procrastinating and what seems to drive it.\\nIS PROCRASTINATION ALWAYS A BAD\\nTHING?\\nSome researchers have suggested that procrastination’s benefits should\\nnot be overlooked. For example, procrastinating gives us longer to come\\nup with solutions, and can also allow us to harness the pressure of a\\ndeadline to energize our efforts. Management professor Adam Grant\\ncited the benefits of procrastination on creativity in his book Originals.\\nAccording to Dr. Grant, our initial ideas tend to be more traditional.\\nGiving ourselves additional time can lead to more innovative solutions,\\nwhich we never reach if we finish the task as soon as possible. These\\npotential advantages need to be weighed against the stress, missed\\ndeadlines, and poorer quality work that are linked to procrastinating.\\nStrategies for Beating Procrastination\\nUnderstanding what causes procrastination gives us clues as to how to\\nbreak out of it. Because there are multiple factors that lead to\\nprocrastination, we need a wide range of tools to choose from to overcome\\nit. These tools can be divided into three domains:•Think (cognitive)\\n•Act (behavioral)\\n•Be (mindfulness)\\nOver time, you can find a set of strategies from these three areas that\\nworks well for you.\\nSome conditions can make procrastination especially likely. Depression\\nsaps our energy and motivation, making it hard to take care of things.\\nIndividuals with ADHD struggle to meet deadlines due to difficulty focusing\\non a task and low motivation to complete it. Anxiety disorders can also lead\\nto procrastination—for example, a person might delay writing an e-mail\\ndue to fear of saying something stupid. While the strategies presented in this\\nchapter can be useful for anyone, take care to address an underlying\\ndiagnosis that might be driving procrastination.\\nTHINK: COGNITIVE STRA TEGIES\\nMuch of our procrastination comes from how we think about the task and\\nabout our willingness and ability to complete it. Strategic changes in our\\nthinking can weaken procrastination’s pull. Refer to chapters 4 and 5 for\\nmore specifics about responding to unhelpful thoughts.\\nNotice permission-giving thoughts that bend the truth\\nBeware of things we tell ourselves to justify procrastination, or that\\ndownplay the amount of time we’ll actually spend doing something other\\nthan the target task (e.g., “I’ll just watch one video first”). When we catch\\nthese thoughts, we can treat them like we would any unhelpful automatic\\nthought (see chapter 4).\\nRemind yourself why you don’t want to procrastinate\\nPutting things off not only can lead to being late or producing poor-quality\\nwork, but colors our leisure time with feelings of dread and guilt about the\\ntask we’re not doing. Remind yourself of these negative consequences\\nwhen you need motivation to get started.Beware of “virtuous avoidance”\\nWhen we’re motivated to avoid a task, we might find other ways to make\\nourselves feel productive—organizing our cabinets, helping a friend, doing\\nbusywork—which can give us the sense that “at least we’re doing good\\nthings.” This belief provides a compelling rationalization that makes\\nprocrastination easier.\\nDecide to start\\nWe often delay doing something because we’re not sure exactly how to do\\nit. For example, we might not write a difficult work e-mail because we\\ndon’t know what we’re going to say. In reality, figuring out how to do it is\\npart of the task. Remind yourself that you’ll find a way once you resolve to\\nget started.\\nAcknowledge that you probably won’t feel like doing it later, either\\nWe might assume we’ll get to a task once we feel like doing it. The truth is,\\nthough, that we probably won’t want to do it later any more than we want to\\ndo it now. We can stop waiting for a magical time down the road when it’s\\neffortless to do the task.\\nChallenge beliefs about having to do something “perfectly”\\nWe often put off starting a task because we’ve set unrealistically high\\nstandards for how well we must do it. Keep in mind that it doesn’t have to\\nbe perfect, it just needs to be done.\\nChoose the Think strategies that resonate with you and write them in\\nyour notebook to practice when needed.\\nBEING ON TIME\\nBeing late reflects a specific type of procrastination, namely a delay in\\nmoving ourselves from one place to another by a deadline. Follow these\\nprinciples if you want to improve your punctuality:\\nBe realistic about the time required. Time how long it actually takes\\nto reach your destination. Be sure to factor in time for incidentals likesaying good-bye to your family and give yourself a buffer for the\\nunexpected (e.g., traffic delays) so you don’t underestimate the actual\\ntime required.\\nCount backward from when you need to be there. Calculate when\\nyou need to leave based on how long it takes to reach your destination.\\nFor example, if you need to arrive by 6 p.m. and it takes 45 minutes\\n(including your buffer), plan to leave no later than 5:15 p.m.\\nSet an alarm (with enough time to avoid being late). Avoid losing\\ntrack of time by setting a reminder, which can also help you relax since\\nyou know you’ll be prompted when it’s time to go.\\nBe careful about setting your clock or watch ahead to help you be\\non time. This strategy often backfires because we know our watch is\\nfast and we can end up disregarding it altogether.\\nAvoid starting an activity close to time to leave. Beware of trying to\\nsqueeze in one more activity before leaving for your destination, even if\\nyou think it will take “just a minute.” There’s a good chance it will take\\nmore time than you have and end up making you late.\\nBring things to do in case you’re early. If you’re afraid of being early\\nand then wasting time with nothing to do, bring a book or some other\\nenjoyable or productive way to pass the time if you’re early.\\nCombine these strategies with other CBT principles from this chapter to\\nmaximize your chances of being on time. For example, use the\\ncognitive technique of reminding yourself how much nicer it is to see\\nyour GPS estimating that you’ll arrive five minutes early versus five\\nminutes late.\\nACT : BEHA VIORAL STRA TEGIES\\nThe more we rely on sheer willpower to push through procrastination, the\\nless likely we’ll break its grip. Rather than trying to muscle our way\\nthrough, we can find greater leverage to overcome avoidance. Some simple\\nchanges in our actions can greatly improve our chances of being productive.Use external reminders\\nWe can boost our odds of starting a task by making it harder to ignore. Set\\nan alarm, post a note for yourself, write your goal on a whiteboard, or put\\nthings where they’ll remind you of what you need to do. If you can’t do it\\nright away, be sure to set another reminder.\\nCreate a distraction-free zone\\nIt’s harder to procrastinate when time wasters aren’t readily available. Close\\nyour Internet browser if possible, silence or put away your cell phone, and\\nremove any other likely distractions. It’s too easy to turn to these things out\\nof habit when feeling anxious (or otherwise uncomfortable) about the task.\\nUse a calendar\\nThe more specific we are about our plans, the more likely we are to\\ncomplete them. Put any task you intend to do into your calendar, and do\\neverything you can to protect that time. If you have to bump the task,\\nreschedule it for as soon as possible.\\nBreak down a big task into manageable subtasks\\nAs discussed in chapter 3, breaking down overwhelming tasks can make it\\nmuch easier to get started. Make the steps as small as necessary to feel\\ndoable. Give each subtask its own mini-deadline so you’ll know you’re on\\ntrack.\\nJust get started\\nSeeing an entire task in front of us can be daunting. Resolve simply to start\\nthe task, and to work on it for a short period of time. For example, maybe\\nyou take five minutes to outline an e-mail you’ve needed to write. There’s a\\nchance you might even keep working past your modest goal.\\nFinish a task, even if it’s hard\\nOn the other end of the project, keep going when the finish line is in sight.\\nYou may as well capitalize on your momentum, rather than having to\\novercome inertia from a cold start when you come back to finish it later.Commit to starting a task imperfectly\\nProcrastination often comes from perfectionism, which can be paralyzing\\nbecause we can’t possibly be perfect. The antidote to perfectionism is\\nembracing imperfection—for example, we can resolve to write an imperfect\\nopening paragraph. This commitment can help us get started, which\\nprovides invaluable momentum.\\nWork next to others who are working\\nUse the positive social pressure of being around working people to spur you\\nto work. We’re less inclined to goof off when those around us are on task.\\nUse shorter, uninterrupted work sessions\\nIt’s easier to get started on a task when we know we’ll be working on it for\\na limited amount of time. Consider trying the Pomodoro technique, created\\nby software developer Francesco Cirillo, in which you do very focused\\nwork for 25-minute intervals and take short breaks in between. There are\\nmany apps that make it easy to use this approach, though, of course, all you\\nneed is a timer. I actually use this approach for all of my writing.\\nFigure out how to do things\\nIf you discover that a lack of knowledge is feeding your procrastination,\\nadd the learning you need as a subtask for what you’re working on. For\\nexample, if you’re not sure how to create a specific type of spreadsheet,\\nplan to watch an online tutorial that covers the topic.\\nGive yourself small rewards\\nUse positive reinforcement to overcome the negative reinforcement of\\nprocrastination. Research shows that even if we change nothing else, giving\\nourselves incentives to work significantly changes our behavior. Maybe you\\ngive yourself a 15-minute break to do whatever you want after working for\\n50 minutes, or you get to eat a small treat after every five pages you read.\\nJust be careful that the rewards don’t keep you from getting back to the\\ntask, like an addictive video game could, for example.Track your progress\\nOne simple way to reward ourselves is by noting our progress toward a\\ngoal. For example, Alec could have made an outline for his paper and\\ncrossed off each section as he completed it. The satisfaction of seeing his\\nprogress would feed his motivation to keep going.\\nBE: MINDFULNESS STRA TEGIES\\nThe third pillar of CBT offers several strategies for pushing through\\nprocrastination, using the principles of presence and acceptance.\\nAccept discomfort\\nWe often treat discomfort as a reason to delay doing something. But maybe\\nit’s not such a bad thing to be uncomfortable in the service of something we\\ncare about more than our comfort. If we’re willing to open to the\\ndiscomfort, we can move through it as we get started on our task.\\nCome into the present\\nProcrastination is often based on fear of not doing well, which is future-\\noriented. When we focus our attention on the present, we can let go of\\nworries about our performance and direct our energy toward whatever piece\\nof the task we’re working on.\\nReturn to your intended focus\\nMeditation teaches our minds to return to their intended focus when we\\nrealize they’ve drifted. That same principle applies to our work—if we start\\nto slip into procrastination, we can catch ourselves and come back to what\\nwe’re working on.\\nNotice and acknowledge how you work best\\nPaying attention to what promotes your productivity can lower the odds of\\nprocrastination. Notice what actually works for you, rather than what you\\nwish worked for you. For example, maybe you like the idea of working\\nfrom home, but in practice you’re never really productive when you do.BEATING INTERNET-BASED\\nPROCRASTINATION\\nIt was hard enough to overcome procrastination before there was the\\nInternet. As psychologist and ADHD expert Ari Tuckman says, “The\\nInternet just keeps going seamlessly on forever, with links leading to\\nlinks.” He suggests the following ways to prevent online time from\\nsidetracking you:\\nAccept that you’ll probably always want to see one more thing.\\nInternet content is designed intentionally to keep us clicking, watching,\\nand reading, so it’s easy to spend more time on it than we intended.\\nThere will always be another article to read, video to watch, or social\\nmedia post to see. Remind yourself that you’ll have to step away at\\nsome point, and better sooner than later.\\nDo work before entertainment. If you must work on the computer, do\\nyour work before doing things like social media. Otherwise you’ll risk\\nspending all your time on unnecessary activities.\\nSet a timer to interrupt absorption in the Internet. As in other\\ncontexts, a timer here has two advantages: reminding you to get back to\\nwork and allowing you to enjoy your downtime because you know it’s\\nfinite.\\nDon’t start using the Internet if you don’t have time. It’s harder to\\nstop online time than it is to avoid it altogether, so better to not even\\nstart if time is short.\\nMAKING YOUR T O-DO LIST WORK FOR YOU\\nThere are more and less effective ways to use to-do lists. Consider these\\nguidelines from psychologist Ari Tuckman for maximizing their usefulness:\\n1Have a single list. Multiple lists are redundant and confusing. Create a\\nsingle master list and give it a place of importance (e.g., a special\\nnotebook).2Use it consistently. A list is only useful if we refer to it as often as we\\nneed to.\\n3Put items in your calendar for specific times. Don’t work directly\\nfrom the list. We’re much more likely to do something if we’ve devoted\\nspace to it in our schedule.\\n4Remove items you’ll never get to. If realistically you’re never going to\\ndo something, it doesn’t belong on your to-do list. Save yourself the mental\\nenergy and guilt by deleting those tasks, and de-clutter your list.\\n5Update your list regularly. Rewrite your list to keep it orderly after\\nyou’ve crossed off and added items to it. The time you take to update it will\\npay off in greater efficiency.\\n6Prioritize items on the list. By indicating which items are high priority,\\nyou can be sure to do those ones first and can relax about not getting to the\\nlower-priority items right away.\\nReady to make your own to-do list using these principles? You can use\\nthe template below to write down activities you need to complete, including\\ntheir due date. Then give each task a priority level (e.g., low/medium/high,\\nor 0–10). Finally, schedule a time in your calendar to complete each\\nactivity. You can find a copy of this form online at\\nCallistoMediaBooks.com/CBTMadeSimple.\\nPRIORITY TASKS DUE DA TEChapter Summary and Homework\\nIn this chapter, we considered why we procrastinate, which generally has to\\ndo with fear of doing something badly or finding it unpleasant. Negative\\nreinforcement and maladaptive thoughts also lead us to postpone doing our\\ntasks.\\nThe Think Act Be framework presents many strategies for beating\\nprocrastination. On their own each of these strategies may have a small\\neffect. For example, research has shown that by itself, rewarding ourselves\\nfor productivity provides only a small advantage. By combining these\\napproaches, we increase our odds of success. It will take trial and error to\\ndiscover what works best for you. With practice, we can develop new habits\\nto replace the ones that promoted procrastination.\\nIf you’re determined to push through procrastination, here’s a plan to\\nget started:\\n1Consider carefully how procrastination is affecting your life.\\n2Identify a task you’ve been meaning to do or one you habitually struggle\\nto do promptly, that you will plan to work on this week.\\n3Choose one or two strategies from each of the domains (Think, Act, Be)\\nto help you complete your task. Take care not to choose so many\\nstrategies that it becomes unmanageable and counterproductive.\\n4Keep track of your progress and what is helpful.\\n5Use additional techniques as necessary.\\n6Maintain a list of techniques to rely on as needed.\\n7Apply what works for you to other areas where you tend to\\nprocrastinate.And, in case it doesn’t go without saying, enjoy the greater success and\\nlower stress that come with completing things on time! Congratulate\\nyourself each time you meet a deadline, and notice how much more relaxed\\nyou feel when you don’t have to fret about unfinished work.CHAPTER EIGHT\\nWork Through Worry, Fear, and Anxiety\\nOverwhelming fear is one of the most crippling emotions. When we’re\\ngripped by fear it’s hard to focus on anything else, as our nervous system is\\non high alert and our bodies brace for action. In this chapter, we’ll consider\\nthe varied manifestations of fear and the tools you’ll need to work through\\nthem.\\nKendra noticed herself sighing once again and felt the beginning of a\\ntension headache. All morning she’d been worried about her mom’s\\nsurgery and thought of checking her phone one more time to see if her\\ndad had called with any news. What if the biopsy revealed her mother\\nhad cancer? She was startled a second later when her phone rang,\\nfumbling with it as she answered, “Dad?” She heard the start of a\\nprerecorded credit card offer and made an exasperated sound as she\\nhung up. She felt her head begin to pound.\\nLike Kendra, all of us are gripped with fear at some point. We may be prone\\nto frequent worries about things that never happen, or maybe we experience\\npanic attacks when speaking in front of a group. Let’s consider a CBT\\nunderstanding of these experiences.\\nA WORD ABOUT TERMINOLOGY\\nPsychologists often distinguish among fear-related words:\\n•Fear happens in the presence of whatever scares the person.\\n•In contrast, anxiety involves an imagined threat that may or may not\\nmaterialize.\\n•Worry is a specific type of anxiety in which we repeatedly think\\nabout feared outcomes in situations involving uncertainty.\\nFor example, we would say that Peter worried that he might encounter a\\ndog as he walked to work, felt anxious when he saw a dog across thestreet, and experienced intense fear when a large dog ran toward him in\\nthe park.\\nOur everyday use of these words is not as precise, and in this chapter I\\nwill adhere more to the common uses of these terms.\\nWhat Is Anxiety?\\nWhile too much anxiety can be debilitating, too little anxiety is not good,\\neither. We need a certain amount of anxiety to motivate us to take care of\\nthings that matter to us.\\nPeter was lying in bed, debating whether to hit snooze one more time.\\nHe checked the clock—6:09 a.m. His train left in one hour. Peter\\nimagined the consequences of having to take a later one, which would\\nmean being late to his first meeting of the day. His boss definitely would\\nnot take that well. Peter sighed, turned off his alarm, and hauled himself\\nout of bed.\\nPeter was experiencing the right amount of anxiety: enough to get him\\nup and out of bed on time, and not so much that he felt overwhelmed or that\\nit impaired his performance. Like Peter, we have the ability to imagine\\nfuture outcomes that depend on our actions. Whether it’s work, a first date,\\na job interview, a competitive event, or anything else, we know our actions\\naffect what happens. This knowledge creates a heightened state of energy\\nand motivation to give our best performance. Recall from chapter 1 that\\nCBT looks at the connections among thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\\nWith anxiety, the thoughts are focused on threat, the feelings include\\nnervousness and fear, and the behaviors include efforts to prevent the feared\\noutcomes.\\nKendra’s experiences with anxiety as she waited for news of her mother\\nlooked like this:Kendra’s worries about her mother’s health fuel her anxiety and\\ntension, which in turn cause her more worried thoughts. Her feelings\\nand behaviors similarly interact and reinforce one another, creating a\\ntightly wound state of anxious apprehension.\\nWhile Kendra’s anxiety manifested as intense worries, there are many\\nways that anxiety shows up in our lives.\\nTHE OPTIMAL LEVEL OF ANXIETY\\nMore than 100 years ago, animal experimenters Robert Yerkes and John\\nDodson provided a clear demonstration of the link between emotion and\\nmotivation. They tested how quickly mice learned a laboratory task. A\\nwrong answer resulted in a shock of varying severity. Their results\\nshowed that the lowest levels of shock led to relatively slow learning, as\\nthe mice seemed insufficiently motivated by mild punishment. The\\nhighest levels of shock similarly produced slow learning, as the mice\\nseemed to have reached a heightened state of arousal that interfered\\nwith learning.Psychologists call this pattern an “inverted U” because of the shape it\\nmakes when graphed.\\nHumans show the same inverted U pattern as a function of their anxiety;\\ntoo little and too much hurt our performance, and modest amounts\\nmaximize our success. For example, moderate amounts of stimulants\\nlike coffee can increase our energy and focus, while higher amounts\\nmake us feel jittery and overstimulated.\\nThe Many Faces of Fear\\nAnxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric diagnoses,\\nencompassing a wide range of conditions. In their most recent revision, the\\ncreators of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\\nedition (DSM-5) removed OCD and PTSD from the anxiety disorders,\\nplacing each one in its own category. There were various reasons for these\\nchanges, but it remains widely understood that both of these conditions can\\nfeature a strong dose of anxiety. PTSD and OCD also respond to similar\\ntreatment approaches as the remaining anxiety disorders, and so they are\\nincluded in this chapter.\\nSPECIFIC PHOBIA\\nExcessive fear of certain stimuli may indicate a specific phobia. The person\\nmay realize their fears are overblown, which doesn’t make it any easier toshake them. Avoidance of the feared object or situation is very common.\\nAnything can become an object of fear, but certain ones are most\\ntypical. They include:\\n•Certain situations (e.g., riding in an elevator, flying in an airplane)\\n•Natural environments (e.g., thunderstorms, heights)\\n•Animals (e.g., spiders, snakes)\\n•Blood-injection-injury (e.g., giving blood, getting a shot)\\nSOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER\\nIt’s normal to feel a moderate amount of anxiety in social situations,\\nespecially when we’re performing or being evaluated. Social anxiety may\\nbe a disorder when it’s so strong that it causes tremendous distress or leads\\na person to avoid situations that would trigger it. Typical feared situations\\ninclude:\\n•Giving a speech or presentation\\n•Talking in a group of people\\n•Eating in front of others\\n•Going to a party\\n•Being the center of attention\\n•Disagreeing with someone\\n•Meeting new people\\nIn each of these situations, the person is afraid of doing something\\nembarrassing or otherwise having others think badly of them. Part of what\\ncan make social anxiety persist is that it’s hard to disconfirm the fears. How\\ndo we know, for example, that people didn’t hate our wedding speech, even\\nif they do the socially expected thing and tell us it was great? The\\nuncertainty inherent in social situations can perpetuate our fears.\\nPANIC DISORDERA panic attack is a discrete spell of intense anxiety, usually accompanied by\\nphysical symptoms like sweating, pounding heart, and shortness of breath.\\nPanic often involves alterations in our sense of reality, such as feeling like\\nthings aren’t real (derealization) or feeling detached from our experience\\n(depersonalization).\\nMost people will have at least one panic attack in their lives. Panic is\\npart of a disorder when it leads to fear that something terrible is happening\\n(e.g., “I’m having a stroke”) or when a person has intense dread of the next\\nattack.\\nPanic attacks are so aversive that people with panic disorder often begin\\nto avoid any situation where they’re liable to panic, especially if it would be\\ndifficult to escape. Common situations people avoid include bridges, movie\\ntheaters (especially sitting in the middle of a row), and trains. This type of\\navoidance may warrant an additional diagnosis of agoraphobia.\\n“Part of being human is managing the balance between anticipating the\\nfuture and accepting its uncertainty. Worry is a sign that the balance has\\nbeen disrupted.” —Susan M. Orsillo and Lizabeth Roemer, The Mindful\\nWay Through Anxiety\\nGENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD)\\nWhile panic disorder represents the sense of immediate danger, GAD\\ninvolves a more diffuse anxiety about future events. The core of GAD is\\ncontinual worry about a wide range of things (as “generalized” suggests).\\nSomeone I know likened GAD to the stress of final exam week but applied\\nto every situation in one’s life. The excessive and uncontrollable worry in\\nGAD leads to symptoms like difficulty concentrating, trouble sleeping,\\nmuscle tension, and restlessness.\\nPOSTTRAUMA TIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)\\nAnxiety is an understandable response when we’ve been through a terrible\\ntraumatic event. Anything that poses a threat to our physical well-being can\\nlead to PTSD, including natural disasters, car accidents, muggings, sexual\\nassaults, and combat, among others. Witnessing something awful happen tosomeone else or learning about a trauma that someone close to us\\nexperienced can also set us up for PTSD.\\nAfter experiencing a terrible trauma, most people will have symptoms\\nlike:\\n1Reimagining and reexperiencing. This includes intrusive memories,\\nnightmares, and strong emotional reactions when reminded of the event.\\n2Avoidance. This includes trying not to think about the trauma, as well as\\navoiding people, places, and things that remind the person of what\\nhappened.\\n3Changes in thinking and mood. For example, we may start to see the\\nworld as a very dangerous place and ourselves as powerless to cope with\\nit. We might also struggle to trust others, and paradoxically begin to\\nengage in risky behaviors. We’re also less likely to experience positive\\nemotions and more likely to experience negative ones.\\n4Hyperarousal. This means our nervous systems are on high alert. We\\nmay have trouble sleeping and concentrating, and may constantly be\\nchecking our surroundings for danger.\\nThese reactions are very typical for nearly everyone after a trauma. To meet\\nPTSD criteria, they have to meet the somewhat arbitrary criterion of lasting\\nmore than one month.\\nOBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)\\nOur brains are wired to detect the possibility of danger and try to avoid it. A\\nglitch in this essential function can lead to OCD. The obsessions in OCD\\nare repetitive thoughts about something bad that might happen, like getting\\nsick, offending God, causing a fire, or harming another person. Naturally a\\nperson wants to avoid these feared outcomes, which leads to the irresistible\\nurge to neutralize the obsessive fear through compulsions.\\nExamples of the obsession–compulsion cycle include:\\nFear of getting sick → Wash handsFear of having hit a pedestrian → Check the rearview mirror\\nFear of having committed blasphemy → Say a ritualized prayer\\nThe compulsions are powerfully reinforcing through the negative\\nreinforcement discussed in chapter 7 (see here). At the same time, people\\nwith OCD usually still feel uneasy after doing the compulsion, because\\nthere is no way to know for sure that what they fear won’t happen. As a\\nresult, a person with OCD is likely to repeat the compulsion and can spend\\nhours a day stuck in the obsession–compulsion cycle.\\nWhile many conditions will improve with various kinds of psychotherapy,\\nOCD requires a specific treatment. The best-tested therapy is called\\nexposure and response prevention, which is a type of CBT. As the name\\nindicates, it involves exposing oneself to the OCD-related fears and giving\\nup the compulsions that maintain the disorder. Check the Resources section\\nof this book if you’re looking for effective OCD treatment.\\nOTHER MANIFEST ATIONS\\nEven if you don’t meet criteria for any of these DSM-5 anxiety conditions,\\nfear can still play an unhelpful role in your life. For example, the subtle and\\nconsistent ways in which we make decisions based on fear can have\\nprofound effects on the course of our lives. What’s more, these\\nmanifestations of fear can be so pervasive we don’t even recognize them.\\nThese are the fears that keep us stuck not in a debilitating disorder but in a\\nlife half-lived.\\nYou can see these kinds of fears at work in:\\n•Holding ourselves back out of fear of success\\n•Avoiding taking reasonable risks out of fear of failure\\n•Living the way we think others expect us to and not how we want to live\\n•Avoiding the vulnerability that comes with true intimacy\\n•Experiencing anger that arises from fear (e.g., being mad at a loved one\\nfor being late because we worried for their safety)Take some time to consider how fear shows up in your own life. While fear\\nis designed to keep us safe, it can keep us from living freely and fully if we\\nlet it guide our actions.\\nLet’s turn now to the tools that can help relieve anxiety.\\nANXIETY AND YOUR BRAIN\\nImagine you’re enjoying a nice walk through the woods when you\\nencounter a slithery thing on the ground. Light that’s reflected off the\\nobject will enter your eyes and fall on your retinas, leading to signals\\nthat travel through the brain’s relay station (the thalamus) and into the\\nprimary visual areas located at the back of your brain. The information\\nis then relayed to other parts of the brain, including memory areas that\\nmatch the object with the concept “snake.”\\nThe fact that you’re seeing a snake is then passed along to other areas,\\nincluding the amygdala, tucked deep inside your brain, which is central\\nto feeling and expressing fear and other emotions. How does your brain\\nknow to fear a snake next to your foot on the ground but not the one\\nbehind the glass at the zoo? The amygdala also gets input from the\\nhippocampus, which is crucial for understanding context. Thanks to\\nyour hippocampus you may even start to feel afraid the next time you\\nwalk through the woods, even if you don’t run into a snake.\\nSignals from the amygdala then activate a brain area called the\\nhypothalamus, which will activate the fight-or-flight response of the\\nsympathetic nervous system through the release of stress hormones like\\nepinephrine (adrenaline). The hypothalamus also triggers the pituitary\\ngland to release hormones into your bloodstream that travel to your\\nadrenal glands (which sit on top of your kidneys), causing them to\\nrelease additional stress hormones like cortisol. Our existence on this\\nplanet has depended on this coordinated response, allowing us to\\nrecognize and respond to threats, like moving away from the snake.\\nJust as it’s important for our survival to learn to fear certain stimuli, it is\\nalso adaptive to learn when danger is minimal so we’re not overly\\nfearful. This new learning depends on providing our brains with newinformation, which anxiety-driven avoidance can prevent. For example,\\nif I always avoid dogs because a big dog knocked me down when I was\\na little kid, I’ll never learn that my early encounter won’t be my typical\\nexperience with dogs. When we practice mindfulness and cognitive\\nbehavioral techniques for dealing with fear and anxiety, we are\\nretraining these brain areas to change their response to things that scare\\nus.\\nStrategies for Working Through Worry, Fear, and\\nAnxiety\\nThere are many tools for managing overwhelming worry, fear, and anxiety,\\nincluding cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness techniques.\\nTHINK (COGNITIVE)\\nWhen our fear is activated, we’re likely to have thoughts that terrify us even\\nmore. For example, if we’re gripped by fear on a plane, we might become\\nconvinced the plane is going to crash, which further heightens our fear and\\ncontinues the cycle (refer to the CBT model of anxiety here). By\\nchallenging our anxious thoughts, we can interrupt this feedback loop.\\nA note of caution: when we’re overwhelmed with anxiety, it’s difficult\\nor even impossible to talk ourselves down with reason alone. These\\ntechniques will tend to be most effective before anxiety has taken over and\\nin combination with behavioral and mindfulness techniques.\\nRemember that anxiety is not dangerous. We often come to fear anxiety\\nitself, believing it’s dangerous to be too anxious. However, as\\nuncomfortable as it can be, anxiety itself is not harmful. Furthermore, fear\\nabout being anxious only leads to more anxiety. Keep in mind even in a\\nsevere bout of anxiety that the physical, mental, and emotional symptoms\\nwill not hurt you.\\nReassess the likelihood of danger. Our fear will convince us that what\\nwe’re afraid of is really going to happen. But keep in mind that anxietydisorders by definition involve unrealistic fears given the actual risk, so the\\nprobability that they will come true is actually quite low. If your fear is\\ntelling you something really bad is likely to happen, you can use the Core\\nBelief form from chapter 5 (see here) to test this belief. How strong is the\\nevidence supporting it? Is there any evidence against it? Has it happened\\nbefore, and if so, with what frequency? If you discover any errors in your\\nthinking, reevaluate the likelihood that what you fear will actually happen\\nin light of the evidence.\\nReassess the severity of threat. Sometimes the thinking error we make\\nisn’t about how likely a negative outcome is but how bad it would be. For\\nexample, Joe thought it would be terrible if people knew he was anxious\\nwhile giving a talk. As he examined this thought, he realized that people\\nmight indeed know he was anxious from the quaver in his voice or his\\nshaking hands, but realized it probably wouldn’t be a big deal. After all,\\nhe’d heard speakers who seemed nervous before, and their anxiety hadn’t\\ncolored his overall perception of the person or the quality of his or her\\nspeech.\\nWhy worry? Worrying is a hard habit to break, especially because we often\\nbelieve we should worry. We might tell ourselves that worrying:\\n•Helps us think of solutions to a problem\\n•Prevents us from being blindsided by bad news\\n•Shows we care\\n•Can make things turn out well\\n•Helps motivate us\\nThese beliefs generally are false. For example, we can’t avoid potential pain\\nby imagining the worst-case scenario, which would be just as upsetting if it\\nactually happened—plus we feel needless distress from countless worries\\nthat never materialize. When we see the futility of worry, we’re more likely\\nto redirect our thoughts.\\nTest your predictions. This technique sits at the intersection of cognitive\\nand behavioral approaches. When you’ve identified a fear about how aspecific situation will turn out, you can design a way to see if your forecast\\nwas right.\\nLily dealt with a lot of social anxiety at work. She was convinced that if\\nshe spoke up in a meeting, her colleagues would ignore her ideas and\\nprobably even criticize them. She wrote down these and other expected\\noutcomes before a meeting, and then she took a risk and volunteered her\\nthoughts. While people seemed a bit surprised when she spoke up,\\nnobody criticized her ideas. In fact, her supervisor asked her to lead a\\nsubgroup that would develop her proposal. After the meeting, Lily wrote\\ndown the actual outcome versus her prediction.\\nAs we saw in chapter 5, our core beliefs can distort our memories,\\nthereby reinforcing our beliefs. It’s important to record when our\\npredictions turn out to be false, to help us encode and remember\\ninformation that’s counter to our expectations. Testing our predictions is\\nclosely tied to exposure, which we’ll explore later in this chapter.\\nACT (BEHA VIORAL)\\nWhen we change how we respond to situations that make us anxious, we\\ncan learn new behaviors that lessen our fear. Let’s review some strategies\\nfor using our actions to combat our anxiety.\\nApproach what you fear. Facing our fears head-on is called “exposure\\ntherapy” in CBT and is the antidote to the avoidance that maintains anxiety.\\n(This assumes, of course, that what we fear is not actually very risky; facing\\na dog that bites won’t fix our phobia of animals, for example.) Exposure to\\nthe things that scare us decreases our anxiety by:\\n•Allowing our nervous system to learn that the danger is exaggerated\\n•Giving us confidence that we can face our fears without being\\noverwhelmed\\n•Reinforcing our awareness that anxiety is not dangerous\\nHundreds of studies have found that exposure is a powerful weapon against\\noverblown anxiety; later in this chapter we’ll go through a step-by-step plan\\nfor implementing exposure.Face your physical manifestations of fear. Anxiety about our anxiety can\\npresent an additional challenge. Panic disorder in particular can feature a\\nfear of the panic-related physical sensations. For example, a person might\\navoid running because the resulting shortness of breath and pounding heart\\nare similar to the feelings during panic. Avoiding physical sensations only\\nstrengthens our fear and makes us more sensitive to the sensations.\\nExposure therapy can decrease our fear of physical anxiety symptoms. For\\nexample, we can do jumping jacks to cause breathlessness, spin in a chair to\\ninduce dizziness, or wear warm clothes to make ourselves sweat. Doing\\nthese kinds of things repeatedly lessens our fear of the physical sensations.\\nLet go of safety behaviors. When we have to do something that scares us,\\nwe often incorporate behaviors that are intended to prevent what we’re\\nafraid of from happening. For example, if we’re afraid of going blank while\\ngiving a talk, we might write out and read our whole presentation. Other\\nexamples include:\\n•Keeping our hands in our pockets in social situations in case our hands\\nshake\\n•Being overly cautious to avoid offending anyone\\n•Traveling with a companion only because of anxiety\\n•Triple-checking an e-mail for mistakes before sending it\\nThere are two main problems with safety behaviors. First, they teach us that\\nbut for the safety behavior, things would have turned out really badly, thus\\nperpetuating the behaviors and our fears. Second, they can actually impair\\nour performance, as when a capable speaker is overly reliant on notes,\\nwhich prevents him from engaging with the audience.\\nIn reality, many of our safety behaviors are useless, but we never realize it if\\nwe always use them (just like a superstitious practice we’re afraid to let go\\nof). We can combine testing our predictions with dropping safety behaviors\\nto directly test whether they’re necessary.\\nBE (MINDFULNESS)Mindfulness provides several ways to manage our fears, through both the\\npresent focus and the acceptance components of the practice. If you haven’t\\nread chapter 6 yet, I encourage you to do so before continuing with this\\nsection.\\nTrain the breath. Our breath is closely connected to our anxiety: slow and\\neven when we’re at ease and fast and sharp when we’re afraid. You can feel\\nthe contrast right now by first taking a series of fast, deep breaths in and\\nout. Notice how you feel. Then breathe in slowly and out even more slowly.\\nFeel the difference? When we’re anxious we often aren’t even aware that\\nour breathing is mirroring our anxiety. Once we become more aware of the\\nquality of our breath, we can practice more relaxed breathing:\\n1Breathe in gently for a count of two.\\n2Exhale slowly to a count of five.\\n3Pause after you exhale for a three-count.\\n4Repeat from step 1 for 5 to 10 minutes, one to two times per day.\\nThese periods of focused attention on the breath will make it easier to\\npractice relaxed breathing when you need it most. When you feel your\\nanxiety start to increase, practice coming back to the breath.\\nFocus on the present. Anxiety grabs our attention and pulls it into the\\nfuture. With practice, we can train the mind to come back to the present. As\\nwe disengage from future-oriented fears, we allow anxiety’s grip to loosen.\\nUse your senses to bring you into the moment, really paying attention to\\nwhat you see, feel, and so forth. Keep in mind that there’s no need to push\\naway your anxiety, which doesn’t work, anyway. Just bring your awareness\\nto your immediate experience, and bring it back when it wanders to your\\nworries.\\nDirect your attention outward. Certain anxiety states, especially panic,\\nsocial anxiety, and illness anxiety, lead to a focus on ourselves—our anxiety\\nsymptoms, our heart rate, worrisome physical sensations, how we’re\\ncoming across to the person we’re talking to, and so forth. This\\npreoccupation only intensifies our anxiety and discomfort. Mindfulness\\noffers the possibility of training our attention outward, to what’s happeningin the rest of the world. For example, we can notice what the people around\\nus are doing, what the sky looks like right at this moment, or the shape of a\\ntree we’ve seen a thousand times but never really noticed. We might find\\nthat we not only interrupt our anxiety-fueling self-focus, but we also step\\ninto a richer experience of life.\\nAccept that what you’re afraid of could happen. Part of what maintains\\nour fear and worry is mental resistance to what we’re afraid might happen.\\nWe can’t know for certain how things will turn out and yet we keep trying\\nin some way to control the outcome. When we accept that we can’t control\\nwhat happens, we can step out of that tension. We can recognize that our\\ntalk could go really badly, we might lose our health, we could be in an\\naccident, and tragedy could befall the people we love. This kind of\\nacceptance is likely to raise anxiety at first—which is probably why we\\navoid it—and then can lead to a greater sense of peace as we give up the\\ncontrol we never had in the first place.\\nEmbrace uncertainty. In the same vein of acceptance, we can\\nacknowledge—even embrace—the inherent uncertainty in our lives. Who\\nreally knows how things will go? That mystery can be terrifying, especially\\nwhen we’d prefer to control everything all the time. At the same time, it is\\nliberating to align ourselves with the nature of life, which is fluid,\\nsurprising, and unpredictable. Since this is the world we inhabit, why not\\nwelcome it?\\nPracticing Exposure Therapy\\nWanting to face our fears is one thing; doing it is another. It helps\\nimmensely to have a structured approach, which CBT offers in exposure\\ntherapy. Effective exposure is:\\n•Intentional: We teach our brains a crucial lesson when we approach our\\nfears on purpose, rather than simply not running away when we come\\ninto contact with them incidentally.\\n•Progressive: We start with easier things and gradually move up to more\\nchallenging ones.•Prolonged: We need to stay with our fears rather than fleeing in order to\\nlearn something new.\\n•Repetitive: Multiple confrontations with our fears can disarm them.\\nWith these principles in mind, follow these steps to conquer your fears:\\n1Create a list of ways to face your fears. Include items on your list that\\nvary in difficulty. Be as creative as you can to come up with a variety of\\nsituations that would trigger your fear.\\n2Rate how difficult each one would be. Make your best guess about\\nhow much distress you would feel in each situation; a 0–10 scale tends\\nto work well, but use a different scale if you prefer. See the example that\\nfollows.\\n3Arrange your items in descending order of difficulty. This ordered\\nlist of exposure ideas is called your “hierarchy.” You might build your\\nhierarchy in a spreadsheet to make it easy to work with. As you review\\nyour list, do you notice any big gaps in your numbers, like a jump from\\na 2 to a 7? If so, look for ways to modify your items to make them easier\\nor harder so you can add intermediate items. For example, doing a\\ndifficult activity with a loved one can make it more manageable, and can\\nfacilitate a transition to doing it on your own.\\nJason was determined to overcome his fear of driving. An abbreviated\\nversion of his exposure hierarchy looked like this:\\nACTIVITY DISCOMFOR T LEVEL (0–10)\\nDrive on the expressway alone 9\\nDrive on the expressway with a friend 7\\nDrive to work 6\\nDrive to the grocery store 5\\nDrive in my neighborhood 4\\nSit in driver ’s seat in parked car 24Plan and complete your initial exposures. Choose an item from your\\nhierarchy and schedule a specific time to do it. It’s best to choose one of\\nlow to moderate difficulty—easy enough that you’ll be setting yourself\\nup for success, and hard enough that you’ll feel good about having done\\nit.\\nBe sure to follow the four principles of effective exposure, particularly\\nstaying through the discomfort. You don’t have to wait until your\\nanxiety is completely gone, but it’s good to reach a point at which it’s at\\nleast beginning to decrease. Running away from an exposure is likely to\\nreinforce our fears. Also take care not to engage in safety behaviors,\\nincluding compulsions if you’re battling OCD.\\n5Continue working up your hierarchy. Repeat each activity until it\\nstarts to feel more manageable. The exposure sessions should be close\\nenough together that the new learning builds on itself; for example, daily\\npractice will be better than weekly. Keep in mind, though, that closer\\ntogether is not always better, as four exposure sessions on the same day\\nare probably not as effective as four consecutive days of exposure.\\nAs you’re ready, move up to more difficult steps. The process will be like\\nclimbing a ladder, with success at lower levels enabling continued success\\nas you climb higher. If you’re unable to complete a challenging exercise,\\nreturn to a lower-level one for additional practice before trying the harder\\none again. It’s normal for fear levels to vary between practice sessions,\\noften for no reason we can discern, so don’t let temporary setbacks knock\\nyou off course. Just keep working your plan.\\nRefer back to the principles as needed while you do your exposures. You\\ncan also incorporate any of the Think Act Be strategies into exposure, such\\nas accepting discomfort. The process of exposure therapy not only will\\nlower your fear but also will increase your willingness and ability to tolerate\\ndiscomfort.\\nChapter Summary and Homework\\nFear can direct our lives in many ways if we let it. In this chapter, we\\nreviewed some of the common anxiety conditions and other ways anxietycan color our experience. We also covered many strategies from the Think\\nAct Be framework for reclaiming your life from overwhelming anxiety and\\nfear.\\nThese individual strategies work well together—for example, practicing\\nacceptance of our feared outcome while we do exposure, and testing our\\npredictions for how we expect it to go. By following a systematic program\\nfor exposure, we can transform our determination to conquer our fears into\\nreal progress.\\nWhen you’re ready to face your fears, here are ways to get started:\\n1Complete a CBT diagram of your fears, identifying your relevant\\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors and their relationships.\\n2Look for subtle ways that fear affects you that aren’t immediately\\napparent.\\n3Choose strategies from the Think, Act, and Be categories to practice in\\nthe coming days.\\n4If you have specific fears that lend themselves well to exposure therapy,\\nbegin with step 1 and work consistently through the plan.\\n5Balance the tough work of facing your fear with consistent self-care (see\\nchapter 10). Being good to yourself will help you through this process.CHAPTER NINE\\nKeep Calm: Manage Excessive Anger\\nAnger can be a powerful emotional experience, for better or worse. In this\\nchapter, we’ll examine problematic anger and ways of managing it\\neffectively.\\nAlan was taken aback when he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror\\nas he waited on hold. The flushed face and furious expression it wore\\nalmost made him laugh. “I look like a maniac,” he thought to himself.\\nHis ordeal had started 45 minutes earlier when he called to exchange a\\nproduct he had ordered. It took him several tries to get through the\\nautomated prompts, as the system kept placing him on hold and then\\ndisconnecting after several minutes. By the time he reached a human\\nbeing he was starting to see red.\\nThe voice on the other end didn’t seem very sympathetic when he\\ncomplained about the difficulty getting through, and when he explained\\nhis request for an exchange, she recited the company policy: “There is a\\n14-day window for returns or exchanges, and unfortunately there are no\\nexceptions.” Alan gritted his teeth and described his extenuating\\ncircumstances: Not receiving the order till after the 14 days had passed,\\nhis recent move, the address update that hadn’t registered. . . . The\\nrepresentative replied with irritating calmness, “Sir, it is the customer’s\\nresponsibility to update their address of record.”\\nFurious, Alan replied, “I’d like to speak with someone who isn’t hard of\\nhearing.”\\n“One moment while I transfer you.” After five minutes of music, the line\\nwent dead. It was all Alan could do not to throw his phone against the\\nwall. Twenty minutes later, he had a similar conversation and unleashed\\na string of expletives, ending by asking to “speak to someone who\\nactually gives a damn about customer service.”\\nWe’ve all experienced irritating situations, whether they’re with\\ncustomer service representatives, customers, friends, spouses, parents, kids,bosses, or strangers. When channeled appropriately, anger can be a force for\\ngood. However, excessive anger has unhealthy effects, both on our health\\nand our relationships.\\nLet’s begin by exploring what anger is and how it’s expressed, and then\\nwe’ll turn to ways of managing it.\\nUnderstanding Anger\\nThere are many words to describe our experiences of anger. Annoyance and\\nirritation describe some milder forms of anger, whereas rage and fury\\nsuggest more intense emotional states. The quality of our anger will vary, as\\nwell. We’ll feel frustrated when our aims are thwarted, exasperated when\\nour anger mixes with disbelief, outraged when we perceive a gross\\nviolation of what’s right. Other descriptions of anger have their own\\nnuances: resentful, bitter, indignant, livid, apoplectic, incensed, vexed,\\ncross, seething, irate, and so forth.\\nWhat do all of these descriptions have in common? In one way or\\nanother there is the sense of having been wronged. We have expectations of\\nhow we want things to go and when someone or something causes a worse\\noutcome than we expected, we’re liable to get angry.\\nThe thoughts we have when things don’t go our way are central to the\\ndegree of anger we feel. During Alan’s customer service experience, he had\\nthought to himself, “This is a complete waste of my time.” Just below his\\nconscious awareness was the related thought, “These people don’t care that\\nthey’re wasting my time.” That interpretation is what sent him over the\\nedge into feelings of rage.\\nAlan also had thoughts related to expressing his anger. As his anger\\nbuilt, he began to feel like he needed to punish the person he was\\ntalking to for mistreating him. “They need to know I’m not a sucker who\\ncan be pushed around,” he told himself.\\nUnbeknownst to Alan, his body was having its own set of reactions. His\\nblood pressure and heart rate had increased as attention had narrowed\\nin on the target of his anger. His breathing also had quickened as heentered a full activation of his sympathetic nervous system, more fight\\nthan flight. He was ready for battle.\\nWe can break down the components of anger to better understand it and\\nto find places in the process to intervene. Our model of anger begins with a\\ntriggering situation—some violation of our expectation of how we should\\nbe treated. Our resulting thoughts, driven by our core beliefs (see chapter\\n5), will lead to emotional and physical reactions. Together these thoughts,\\nfeelings, and physical sensations comprise our subjective experience of\\nanger.\\nWe make an important distinction in this model between our experience\\nof anger and our expression of anger. The former clearly influences the\\nlatter, of course, since we have to experience anger before expressing it.\\nHowever, we can exercise some choice in whether and how we act on our\\nanger.\\nFor example, when someone cuts us off in traffic we might decide to let\\nour grievance go rather than retaliating. Or we might channel our anger into\\na measured response, taking care to keep our wits about us. At other times,\\nwe might give full vent to our wrath, attacking the target of our anger with\\nharsh words or even physical actions. At the extreme the outcome of\\nuncontrolled anger can include abuse or even homicide.\\nOur thoughts will strongly influence how we express our anger. We’re\\nmore likely to act on our anger when we have beliefs like if people treat me\\nbadly, I need to punish them. These kinds of beliefs give rise to permission-\\ngiving thoughts that facilitate our anger expression—thoughts like, “I\\nshould teach them a lesson,” or “They deserve it.”The Utility of Anger\\nAs with our other emotions, anger exists for good reason. Anger is a highly\\nenergized state and can give us the impetus to stand up for ourselves and for\\nwhat is right. For example, cars in my neighborhood kept running red lights\\nat the intersection where families cross a busy road to get to the playground,\\nincluding several times as we waited to cross with our own kids. My sense\\nof what was right—kids need a safe intersection to get across the street—\\nhad been violated, and my resulting anger led me to contact our local\\ncommissioner about having more safety measures added to the intersection.\\nAnger can be extremely motivating.\\nAnger is also a clear sign to others that they have violated our\\nboundaries. We generally pay attention when someone is mad, so anger can\\nactually facilitate clear communication. Indeed, under-expressing anger can\\nbe as much of a problem as overexpressing it. Just as we saw with anxiety,\\nanger becomes a problem when we experience it to such a degree that its\\ncosts outweigh its benefits. We might feel angry all the time, even for no\\napparent reason. We may be quick to make faulty interpretations that lead to\\nanger, like assuming people are criticizing us when in fact they are not.\\nMaybe we have a hard time coming down from episodes of anger, or we\\nexpress anger in unhealthy ways.\\nSeveral psychological conditions can lead to problems with anger. Although\\ndepression is linked most obviously to feeling down, irritability is a very\\ncommon symptom. Irritability or even aggression can also be part of the\\nhyperarousal in PTSD. The pervasive worry in GAD often leads to\\nirritability, as well. Similarly, individuals with OCD may get angry if they\\nsee others as triggering their obsessions or thwarting their compulsions. It\\nis important to treat an underlying condition that may be contributing to\\nexcessive anger. As the condition improves, anger and irritability should\\ndiminish.\\nWhat Contributes to Excessive Anger?People vary in how often and how intensely they experience and express\\nanger. The following mental processes have been linked to high anger\\nlevels.\\nSELECTIVE A TTENTION\\nPeople prone to anger tend to pay attention to things that trigger anger. A\\nperson might be primed to notice other drivers’ offensive behaviors, for\\nexample, or to focus on things his or her partner says that might be critical.\\nThe more we look for these things, the more cause we’ll find to be angry.\\nBIASED THINKING\\nAs we saw in chapter 5, our core beliefs drive our thoughts in triggering\\nsituations. The more we interpret others’ actions as hostile, inconsiderate,\\nand so forth, the more we’ll experience anger.\\nRUMINA TION\\nIt’s easy to get stuck in our heads about things that made us angry, turning\\nthem over and over. We’ll replay interactions that upset us, wonder how\\nothers could treat us so unfairly, and even create scripts for irritating\\narguments that may never happen. Dwelling on anger-related memories and\\nmoods only exacerbates our anger.\\nPLANNING IN ADVANCE TO MANAGE\\nANGER\\nAngry episodes don’t just happen—they generally have specific\\nantecedents. We can often understand in hindsight the chain of events\\nthat led to our anger. These conditions were like dry wood and all it\\ntook was a spark to ignite a blaze of anger. With practice, we can start to\\nlook down the road and see warning signs before we fly off the handle.\\nOnce we see what’s ahead we can use the strategies that work well for\\nus: adopting a helpful mind-set, lowering our emotional arousal with a\\nfew calming breaths, allowing ourselves adequate time to minimize asense of pressure, and other techniques presented in this chapter. We\\ncan’t always avoid episodes of anger, but we can prevent perfect setups\\nby planning in advance when possible.\\nStrategies for Dealing with Excessive Anger\\nAnger typically is fast and impulsive. We describe an angry person as being\\nquick-tempered or a hothead. We feel a flash of anger and are tempted to\\nlash out. We need ways to slow down, cool things off, and find space to\\nchoose how we react.\\nEach of the strategies for defusing anger is a way to keep you in the\\ndriver’s seat, rather than being hijacked by emotion. The techniques\\npresented here will fall into the familiar categories of Think (cognitive), Act\\n(behavioral), and Be (mindfulness).\\nTHINK (COGNITIVE)\\n•Know your triggers. Most of us have people or situations that\\nconsistently test our patience. Common examples include driving, being\\npressed for time, or certain topics of disagreement with a loved one.\\nMany of the strategies for dealing with anger require knowing in\\nadvance what’s likely to irritate us. Take some time to write down your\\ncommon triggers.\\n•Remember the costs of excessive anger. When you are angry, it’s easy\\nto ignore the consequences of indulging in it. What has anger cost you\\nthat motivates you to work on managing it? How has it affected your\\npeace of mind? Your closest relationships? Your professional life?\\n•Examine your thoughts. Use the techniques from chapter 4 to identify\\nand examine your anger-related thoughts. Look for thinking errors that\\nmay be fueling your anger. Are there alternative beliefs or explanations\\nthat would make more sense and be less irritating?\\nThe basement lights were on again. Rick swore aloud. “The kids never\\nremember to turn off the lights,” he thought with irritation. Then he\\nrealized—it was only the second time this week. Rick still wanted hiskids to be more consistent, but he felt less annoyed after checking his\\nthinking.\\nIt can be unrealistic to change our thinking in the heat of the moment, as\\nanger may overpower our reason. At those times simply note the thoughts\\nthat are going through your head and return to evaluate them when you’re\\nfeeling calmer.\\n•Question your “shoulds.” One word that often shows up in our anger-\\ninducing thoughts is “should”:\\n“This shouldn’t be so hard.”\\n“They should treat me better.”\\n“These drivers should go faster.”\\nThese “shoulds” generally reflect an error in thinking, for while we\\nmight prefer a certain outcome, there’s no actual rule that’s being\\nviolated. Checking our sense of violation can diminish unnecessary\\nanger.\\n•Talk yourself down. Practice talking to yourself the way you would to a\\nfriend who’s upset. Come up with words or phrases that encourage you\\nto calm down when you’re starting to wind up. Examples include:\\n“Take it easy.”\\n“Be cool.”\\n“Breathe through this.”\\n“No need to get bent out of shape.”\\n•Notice when you’re feeding anger-related thoughts. We can fuel our\\nown anger even without any ongoing stimulus by mentally going over\\nthings that upset us. Ruminating on our anger in this way can include\\nimagined conversations that we find upsetting—even getting mad about\\nmade-up interactions! Mindfulness practices are well suited to help\\nredirect rumination (see chapter 6).•Remember your larger goal. Anger narrows our focus onto the target\\nof our anger, which can crowd out our bigger goals. For example, we\\nmight lose sight of the relationship we’re trying to foster with our kids\\nwhen we’re frustrated with them. Write down the ways in which anger\\nhas interfered with your goals. When you feel anger rising, remind\\nyourself of the things that are important to you.\\n•Question your explanations of others’ behavior. When we make a\\nmistake, we tend to find causes outside of ourselves to account for them.\\nWhen others make mistakes, we blame them on the person. For\\nexample, I used to get annoyed with drivers who had their lights off at\\nnight and didn’t turn them on when I toggled my high beams; I assumed\\nthey must be morons. Then one night I did it myself, getting all the way\\nto my destination without realizing I’d forgotten to turn on my lights. I\\nrealized we can all make this mistake, and I stopped getting annoyed\\nwith these drivers.\\nWhen you notice that you’re attributing others’ faults to their character,\\nask yourself if there’s a kinder and more accurate explanation. Maybe\\nthe driver who cut you off is on the phone with the doctor about his sick\\nchild, rather than simply being “a jerk.” The attributions we make for\\nothers’ behavior have a big impact on our anger.\\n•Question your “have to” assumptions. Anger can lead to imperatives:\\n“I have to teach that driver a lesson,” “My child has to stop talking back\\nto me,” “You have to admit I’m right.” These thoughts can compel us to\\ntake actions we’ll soon regret because with few exceptions, the thoughts\\nare overstated preferences. For example, I might really want you to\\nadmit I’m right—and if you don’t, life will go on. Mindful acceptance\\n(see chapter 6) is a good fit here.\\n•Question the utility of angry responses. Anger is good at justifying\\nitself, both its presence and the actions it can lead to. For example, most\\ndrivers who retaliate against other drivers say they do so to teach the\\ndrivers a lesson so they’ll improve their driving. Does it help? We don’t\\nhave data to answer that question directly, but consider this: Have you\\never resolved to be a better driver because of an angry motorist’sbehavior toward you? With that idea in mind, beware of thoughts that\\nmake lashing out in anger sound like a good plan.\\nACT (BEHA VIORAL)\\nOur experience and expression of anger also depend on the behaviors we\\npractice. Consider the following actions that can help you manage your\\nanger.\\nGet enough sleep. As my colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania\\nhave shown, being sleep deprived lowers our ability to tolerate minor\\nfrustrations. Inadequate sleep can also lower our inhibitions, increasing our\\nrisk for aggression and even violence. See chapter 10 for more on sleep.\\nNotice other states of physical discomfort. Our physical state has a big\\ninfluence on our irritability and anger. When we’re hungry, in pain, or\\notherwise uncomfortable, we’re going to have a harder time controlling our\\nanger. Personally I’ve had countless times when I’ve gotten cranky while\\ncooking dinner, not realizing I was overheating. Something as simple as\\ntaking off my sweater can work wonders. The more we tend to our physical\\nwell-being, the less prone we’ll be to problematic anger.\\nProvide yourself with adequate time. When we’re running late we tend to\\nfeel stressed out and impatient—a perfect recipe for an angry outburst if\\nthings don’t go our way. Give yourself enough time for what you need to do\\nto prevent unnecessary stress and anger.\\nPostpone arguments when necessary. Most disagreements don’t have to\\nbe resolved immediately. If you find that conflict is escalating or you’re\\nreaching your boiling point, plan to pause the discussion until you’ve\\ncalmed down. Our anger can tell us we need to resolve this now, but ask\\nyourself—have you ever regretted dealing with something calmly versus in\\nthe heat of anger?\\nAssert your needs. Many of us alternate between passivity and aggression\\nwhen others do things that interfere with our needs. When we swallow our\\nanger, we create pressure that eventually can come out all at once.Martin lay in bed listening to his neighbor’s loud music—it was the\\nfourth night this week he’d been kept awake by it. Finally he’d had\\nenough. Throwing on his robe and slippers, he walked to his neighbor’s\\napartment and pounded on the door. When his neighbor finally opened\\nit, Martin started screaming at him.\\nWe can deal with violations of our needs more effectively when we\\naddress them as they happen versus storing them up and accumulating\\nfrustration and resentment. See the Resources section to learn more about\\nassertiveness.\\nBE (MINDFULNESS)\\nThe tools of mindfulness can be invaluable when emotions are hot and it’s\\nhard to think. Anger compels us to act impulsively; as Dr. Aaron T. Beck\\nhas suggested, we can reframe anger as signaling an imperative not to act,\\nsince we’ll probably regret actions we take in anger even though our\\nthoughts in the heat of the moment will tell us otherwise. Often the best\\nthing to do when we’re angry is nothing. I’ve included in this section some\\nrelaxation techniques, which are not mindfulness practices in the strictest\\nsense but have considerable overlap with a mindfulness approach.\\n•Focus on the present to disengage from anger rumination. As\\ndiscussed earlier, ruminating on things that upset us only perpetuates our\\nanger, yet it isn’t easy to disengage from these repetitive thoughts. We\\ncan use whatever we’re doing as a focal point to connect our attention to\\nthe present, rather than staying in our heads. For example, if we’re\\nmaking dinner, we can tune in to the sensations of chopping vegetables,\\nthe sounds of sautéing, the smells of onion and garlic cooking, and so\\nforth. See chapter 6 for more on mindfulness in daily activities.\\n•Practice acceptance. So much of our anger stems from the belief that\\nthings should be different than they are. Through mindful awareness we\\nlet go of these judgments. Rather than railing against outcomes we don’t\\nlike, we can open to what is happening. This practice can be particularly\\nhelpful for releasing resentful rumination.•Recognize your anger. Through the practice of mindfulness, we can\\nbecome more aware of our anger-related thoughts, feelings, and\\nbehaviors. For example, we might notice that we’re feeling tense and\\nready for a fight as we broach a difficult topic with our spouse. This\\nawareness gives us opportunities for managing our anger before it leads\\nus to do things we regret.\\n•Learn your patterns. Mindfulness can also raise our awareness of\\ncertain times or situations when we tend toward anger.\\nGene realized he fell easily into irritability and impatience most nights\\nafter dinner. He would be short with his family members and quick to get\\nfrustrated. By stepping out of autopilot mode, he was able to use\\nstrategies for managing his emotions at these vulnerable times.\\n•Identify your primary emotions. Anger often comes from other\\nemotions. For example, we might feel hurt or rejected and respond with\\nanger, which in a way might be a more comfortable emotion for us. Or\\nperhaps we feel fear that triggers us to lash out, as when a fellow driver\\nnearly causes an accident and our fear response quickly morphs into\\nrage. Notice what might be beneath your anger at times. Once we’re\\naware of a feeling that led to anger, we can deal with the source of the\\nemotion rather than getting lost in the overlay of anger.\\n•Relax. Anger is a state of tension, and physical relaxation can defuse it.\\nA simple reminder to ourselves to relax, accompanied by a calming\\nbreath, can lessen our tension. It also helps to practice deep relaxation\\nwhen we’re not in the grip of anger so that we can let go of tension on\\ncommand (see section on progressive muscle relaxation).\\n•Breathe with your anger. We don’t have to react to our anger, but\\ninstead can learn to tolerate it. By breathing with the anger, we can open\\nto the experience of being angry, allowing it to run its course like a wave\\nthat rises, crests, and falls. Mindful breathing will also engage your\\nparasympathetic nervous system, which quiets the fight-or-flight\\nresponse.\\n•Observe the anger. We can take a small step back from our anger by\\ntaking the role of observer of our experiences. Rather than identifying\\n100 percent with being angry, we can maintain some perspective on ourreactions, seeing them as passing through us. When we watch our angry\\nreactions like this we start to recognize that we don’t have to act on the\\nthoughts and feelings.\\nMEDITATION FOR MANAGING ANGER\\nIn the following practice we use the body and the breath as vehicles to\\nmanage unresolved anger.\\n1.Begin with a few moments of basic breath meditation (see here).\\nFeel your body and any sensations that are present from your toes to\\nyour head.\\n2.Picture as vividly as possible the circumstances that led to your\\nanger, opening to the emotions they provoke.\\n3.Notice where the anger expresses itself in the body—for example, a\\nclenched jaw or a knot in the stomach. Breathe with these physical\\nmanifestations of anger. Bring compassion to your experience,\\nmaking room for the emotion. Let it be what it is. Take care not to\\nresist the feelings or criticize yourself for the reactions you’re\\nhaving.\\n4.Practice being the witness of your own experience, observing your\\nemotions without becoming completely entangled in them. If you\\nstruggle to take the role of observer, that’s OK, too—it’s easy to get\\nwrapped up in anger. If at any point you feel overwhelmed with\\nemotion, gently direct the attention to the breath until the grip of\\nanger loosens.\\n5.Continue to breathe with the physical sensations for as long as you\\nlike, noticing how emotions change over time. When the intensity of\\nthe anger has abated, bring the attention back to the breath before\\nopening your eyes. Notice how you feel.\\nThis meditation allows us to practice pausing between feeling angry and\\nreacting, giving us greater choice in how we manage strong emotions.Chapter Summary and Homework\\nUncontrolled anger can lead to conflict, aggression, and even violence. In\\nthis chapter, we examined the factors that lead to excessive anger and\\ndescribed ways to manage it. Keep in mind that the goal is not to banish\\nanger from our lives. Instead, we can learn to keep it in check. Things to\\npractice from this chapter include:\\n1Complete a diagram for a specific situation that made you angry to learn\\nmore about your own experience of anger.\\n2Use a thought record to capture and examine some of your anger-related\\nthoughts for a situation that comes up.\\n3Begin to note situations in which you’d like to practice managing your\\nanger.\\n4Choose one or two techniques from the Think, Act, and Be categories to\\nstart practicing.\\n5Write down how each technique works for you, and add new ones as\\nneeded.\\n6Refer to your list of strategies often to remind yourself of the best ways\\nfor you to manage your anger.CHAPTER TEN\\nBe Kind to Yourself\\nUp to this point, we’ve covered the fundamentals of cognitive, behavioral,\\nand mindfulness-based strategies, and we’ve seen how these practices can\\nhelp us manage strong emotions. In this chapter, we examine practical ways\\nof taking care of ourselves—mind, body, and spirit.\\nJohn grimaced as the alarm clock went off. “You have to start getting to\\nbed earlier,” he told himself as he sat up and rubbed his eyes.\\nAfter taking a quick shower, John grabbed a cup of coffee and a frozen\\nwaffle, eating fast as he thought about the big day ahead at work. As he\\nput his dishes in the sink, he braced himself to face the morning rush\\nhour.\\nIn the car he divided his attention between listening to the radio news\\nwith its daily reminder of all that was wrong in the world and worrying\\nabout all the ways he could mess up at work today.\\nThe morning went surprisingly well and by noon John was famished\\nand ready for a break; however, when his coworkers invited him to join\\nthem for lunch at the deli, John decided he hadn’t gotten enough done to\\ntake a real lunch break. Instead he grabbed some snacks from the\\nvending machine to eat at his desk, along with a soda for the caffeine\\nand sugar boost.\\nHe made three more trips to the vending machine that afternoon for\\nmore peanut butter crackers and M&Ms—once because he was hungry,\\nonce when he was bored and anxious, and once in the late afternoon for\\nanother diet cola to power him through his 4 o’clock slump.\\nAfter the second stressful commute of the day, John thought about\\nhitting the gym before dinner, but wasn’t sure he had the energy. Instead\\nhe took the leftover pizza and two beers out of the refrigerator and ate\\nin front of the TV. Afterward he finished a pint of ice cream.Around midnight John started to nod off in front of the TV. His sleep\\nhadn’t been good lately so he tried his best not to wake himself up as he\\nwalked upstairs to bed. Despite his desperate wishes to the contrary, he\\nwas fully awake as soon as his head hit the pillow. “I’m going to be a\\nwreck tomorrow,” he thought as he tried harder to fall asleep.\\nAfter tossing and turning for an hour, John turned the TV back on to\\nhelp him sleep. It was still on the next morning when his alarm went off,\\nand John cringed when he realized it was only Tuesday. “You’ve got to\\nstop doing this to yourself,” he said.\\nJohn is stuck in a cycle of behaviors that are depleting his energy and\\nhurting his mood. As the figure below demonstrates, his habits affect his\\nmood and his energy, which in turn perpetuate his habits.\\nFor example, John’s caffeine consumption interferes with his sleep, which\\nmakes him tired and unmotivated to exercise. The lack of exercise doesn’t\\nhelp his mood or his energy levels, which compels him to continue relying\\non caffeine for energy in the daytime and on alcohol to unwind and fall\\nasleep at night. On top of these unhelpful habits, John consistently second-\\nguesses and criticizes himself.\\nWhat would we think if John had a life coach who was directing him to\\nact in these ways? We would probably think he had a terrible coach, guiding\\nhim to continue these bad habits. We might even wonder if the coach really\\ncared about John. And yet the reality is that in a very real way, John wasacting as his own coach and was giving himself the instructions he was\\nfollowing.\\nLet’s consider some of the most important ways to take care of\\nourselves that help us feel good and move toward our goals.\\nSleep Tight\\nWe need adequate sleep to function at our best. Unfortunately, millions of\\nadults in the United States are sleep deprived, either because they don’t give\\nthemselves enough time in bed or because they have insomnia.\\nHOW MUCH SLEEP DO YOU NEED?\\nMost of us have heard that we need eight hours of sleep per night. In reality,\\nit’s not quite that simple. The latest guidelines from the National Sleep\\nFoundation recommend seven to nine hours of sleep per night for most\\nadults (seven to eight for older adults). A minority of individuals actually\\nneed only six hours.\\nHow do you figure out where you fall in that range? Consider tracking\\nyour sleep for two weeks, noting the time you went to bed and the time you\\ngot out of bed. Subtract the approximate amount of time you were awake at\\nthe beginning, middle, and end of the night. Based on the numbers for each\\nnight, you can calculate the average amount of sleep you’re getting.\\nFor example, let’s say you go to bed at 10:30 p.m. and get up at 6:30\\na.m., so you’re in bed for eight hours. It takes you 10 minutes to fall asleep\\nand you’re generally awake in the night for 20 minutes or so, and then sleep\\nthrough until your alarm at 6:30 a.m. Your total sleep time for this night\\nwould be eight hours minus 30 minutes, so seven and a half hours of sleep.\\nIf you often feel sleepy during the day and you don’t suffer from a\\nmedical condition that would account for it (e.g., sleep apnea), you\\nprobably need more sleep than you’re getting. If you wake up consistently\\nfeeling relatively refreshed and aren’t overly sleepy during the day (and\\naren’t relying on caffeine or other stimulants to stay awake), you’re\\nprobably getting enough sleep.PROBLEMS FROM T OO LITTLE SLEEP\\nVirtually every area of our life suffers when we’re not getting enough sleep:\\nour mood, energy, concentration, relationships, work performance, driving\\nability, and more. Nevertheless, countless men and women push through the\\nsleepiness, use stimulants to keep going, and ignore the likely costs of\\nmissed sleep. It can be hard to make sleep a priority when it seems like\\nwasted time and that we’re doing nothing. Hanging out with friends, getting\\nmore work done, watching our favorite shows, and countless other activities\\ncompete with our need for sleep.\\nHowever, sleep is anything but a state of inactivity. While our bodies\\nmight be still, our brains are busy at work, as getting the proper amount of\\nsleep leads to better learning and memory. Sleep also facilitates healing in\\nour bodies, and sleep deprivation has been shown to raise levels of\\ninflammatory markers in the body. When we deprive ourselves of sleep, it is\\nto our own detriment.\\nIf you want to get more sleep but have struggled to make it a priority,\\nconsider what you might tell a good friend. How might you help that friend\\nusing the tools of CBT? Like any other task, we would plan a specific time\\nto get in bed, depending on when we planned to get up and how much sleep\\nwe were aiming for. We might also set an alarm to alert us when we should\\nstart our bedtime routine. Refer to chapter 7, as many of the practices\\npresented there apply to the problem of delaying our bedtime.\\nAs you start to feel the reward from getting more sleep, you’ll be\\nmotivated to continue prioritizing your rest. You might also find you’re\\nsharper and more productive during the day, which can make up for having\\nfewer hours of awake time.\\nHOW T O FIX A BROKEN SLEEP CYCLE\\nBut what if your problem isn’t getting in bed on time—what if you’re\\nspending plenty of time in bed and yet aren’t able to sleep? If you\\nconsistently struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep, or if you wake up long\\nbefore you intend to, you may be suffering from insomnia along with\\nmillions of other U.S. adults. Insomnia often starts with a clearly causedsleep disruption. We may be taking a medication that interferes with our\\nsleep or perhaps work stress is keeping us up at night.\\nUnderstandably we’ll try to make up for the sleep we’re losing by going\\nto bed earlier, sleeping in after a bad night’s sleep, or taking naps.\\nUnfortunately, we often end up making it worse in the process. If you sleep\\nin, for example, you’re probably going to have a hard time falling asleep\\nthat night. Lying in bed unable to sleep usually leads to anxiety about sleep,\\nwhich aggravates the insomnia. As a result, we may continue to sleep\\npoorly even after the original issue (e.g., work stress) has been resolved.\\nThe number one treatment for chronic difficulty sleeping is cognitive\\nbehavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). The guidelines from CBT-I are\\ngood sleep practices in general, and include:\\n•Going to bed and getting up at the same time every day\\n•Planning to be in bed only for the amount of time you’re actually able to\\nsleep\\n•Using the bed for sleeping only (sex is an exception) to strengthen the\\n“bed equals sleep” association\\n•Getting out of bed if you’re having a hard time sleeping to break the link\\nbetween bed and being anxious about not sleeping\\n•Challenging unhelpful thoughts about sleep (e.g., catastrophizing about\\nhow terrible the next day will be due to bad sleep)\\n•Practicing relaxation to counteract the tension and anxiety that typically\\ngo along with insomnia\\n•Practicing mindful awareness and acceptance to interrupt sleep-related\\nworries and to let go of efforts to force yourself asleep\\n•Following other practices that promote good sleep, like limiting caffeine\\nintake (especially after lunchtime); making the bedroom cool, dark, and\\nquiet; keeping electronics out of the bedroom; and exercising regularly\\n•Avoiding napping in general, which can make it harder to sleep well at\\nnight\\n•Having a winding-down routine that signals your body and brain that\\nbedtime is approaching (e.g., gently stretching, reading for pleasure, ordrinking a cup of herbal tea)\\nIf you’ve been struggling with poor sleep, are there sleep guidelines\\nyou’d like to follow this week? Write your plans in your notebook.\\nNourish Your Body and Brain\\nIt’s well known that foods we put in our bodies affect our physical health.\\nFor example, if we eat large amounts of sugar, we’ll be more prone to\\nobesity and related health problems like type 2 diabetes. We’ll also\\nexperience spikes in our blood sugar followed by crashes, leading to low\\nenergy and sugar cravings that continue the cycle.\\nThere is mounting evidence that our diet also has a big impact on our\\nmental and emotional well-being, which has led to a new mental health\\nfield called nutritional psychiatry/psychology.\\nEATING FOR MENT AL HEAL TH\\nWhile specific dietary recommendations for mental health vary, they\\nconsistently call for eating minimally processed food—in particular, lots of\\nvegetables and fruits, nuts, legumes, potatoes, whole grains, fish, and\\nhealthy fats like olive oil. Foods to limit or avoid include highly processed\\nfoods, refined sugar, fast food, and trans fats (e.g., hydrogenated oil).\\nThese recommendations are similar to the “Mediterranean diet” and are\\nbased on studies over the past decade showing that these dietary habits\\nsignificantly affect mental health. For example, a 2009 study in the British\\nJournal of Psychiatry found that a diet high in processed food raised the\\nodds of developing depression by as much as 58 percent over a five-year\\nperiod. Other research has shown similar effects of diet on anxiety\\ndisorders.\\nBased on these associations, the first study of its kind used a\\nMediterranean-style diet plus fish oil supplements as a treatment for\\ndepression. Results showed that the dietary changes led to greater\\nimprovement than did the control condition, producing an average reductionin depression symptoms of nearly 50 percent by three months, which was\\nmaintained at six months.\\nOne of the advantages of the Mediterranean diet, besides the health\\nbenefits, is that it also tends to be appealing since it’s not overly restrictive.\\nThe guidelines allow for a wide variety of colorful fruits and vegetables,\\nplenty of satisfying healthy fats, and sufficient protein.\\nResearchers have tried to determine how diet affects our mental health,\\nand a key factor seems to be inflammation. For example, one study found\\nthat a diet high in foods that trigger the body’s inflammation response more\\nthan doubled a person’s odds for developing depression. Interestingly, this\\nassociation may hold only for women, though men would do well to follow\\nthe same dietary guidelines.\\n“The more one eats a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, high in healthy fats,\\nnuts, and fish, and low in processed food (a Mediterranean-style diet), the\\nmore one is protected from developing a mental disorder.” —Julia J.\\nRucklidge and Bonnie J. Kaplan\\nCHALLENGES T O EA TING FOR HEAL TH\\nGiven the considerable advantages of eating a healthy diet, what makes it so\\nhard for so many people to follow these guidelines? Much of the problem is\\nsimply the inconvenience. Consider John from earlier in this chapter. When\\nhe was pressed for time, it was easy to reach for convenience foods like\\nfrozen waffles and vending-machine snacks. When you’re hurrying through\\nthe train station and need to grab something on the go, there are countless\\nquick, easy, and less healthy options. The same is true at home: Eating well\\nrequires advance planning, like picking recipes, making a grocery list,\\ngoing to the grocery store, and learning how to cook if we don’t already\\nknow how. In contrast, highly processed options are often as easy as\\nopening a bag.\\nConvenience foods also tend to provide a triple hit of fat, sugar, and\\nsalt, which is a highly reinforcing combination. We face an uphill struggle if\\nwe intend to eat for health, and can end up consuming foods that are mostly\\nvarious shades of tan, made from ingredients we don’t recognize and can’tpronounce. If you’re committed to eating better, make a plan for moving\\ntoward that goal. I’ve included a link to information from the Mayo Clinic\\nin the Resources section to get you started. Based on the benefits of a\\nhealthy diet—including not just our mental health but also better physical\\nhealth and a longer life—the investment in ourselves is well worth the\\neffort.\\nMove Your Body\\nAs with a sound diet, consistent exercise is an essential part of all aspects of\\nhealth. The benefits of exercise on physical health are no secret; research\\nstudies have shown that exercise also has positive effects on psychological\\nconditions like anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and substance use\\ndisorders, as well as chronic pain and neurodegenerative conditions like\\nAlzheimer’s disease. The effects of exercise have been studied most with\\ndepression, for which the benefits tend to be quite large. Both aerobic (e.g.,\\nrunning) and anaerobic (e.g., weight lifting) exercise can improve mental\\nhealth.\\nHOW DOES EXERCISE HELP?\\nThere are many avenues whereby exercise can be beneficial. These include:\\n•Better sleep, which is associated with improved mental health\\n•A release of endorphins, the body’s natural “feel good” chemicals\\n•A sense of accomplishment from having exercised and from increased\\nfitness\\n•Distraction from unhealthy thought patterns like rumination\\n•Increased blood flow to the brain\\n•Improvement in executive functions like organization and focus\\n•Social contact with others who are exercising\\n•Spending time outdoors (when applicable); see the section “Spend Time\\nOutside” on being in natureHOW T O GET ST ARTED\\nIf you’re ready to take advantage of the many benefits of exercise, follow\\nthe steps from chapter 3 for behavioral activation:\\n1Start by defining what’s important to you about physical activity. For\\nexample, is it about doing something that brings you joy or feeling like\\nyou’re taking care of yourself?\\n2Find activities you enjoy, which may not even fall under the label\\n“exercise.” They might include going for walks with a friend, playing\\ntennis, or taking a dance class, for example. The more you enjoy the\\nmovement, the more motivated you’ll be to do it consistently.\\n3Plan specific times to exercise, and schedule them in your calendar. Start\\ngradually so you won’t feel overwhelmed by your goals.\\nWith thoughtful planning, you can add regular exercise into your routine\\nand enjoy the all-around positive effects on your well-being.\\nManage Stress\\nAnything that creates a demand on our physical, mental, or emotional\\nresources will produce some amount of stress, making stress an unavoidable\\npart of life. Just like with our emotions, the goal is not to eliminate stress\\nfrom our lives but to learn how to manage it effectively. In his seminal\\nwork, Hungarian endocrinologist Hans Selye revealed there is a common\\nstress response regardless of the source of the stress. It doesn’t matter\\nwhether we’re being chased by an alligator or giving a speech—the\\nsympathetic nervous system will engage to help us meet the challenge.\\n“On an incredibly simplistic level, you can think of depression as occurring\\nwhen your cortex thinks an abstract negative thought and manages to\\nconvince the rest of the brain that this is as real as a physical stressor.” —\\nRobert Sapolsky, Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers\\nSelye discovered we handle short-term stress really well: Our body\\nmounts a response, we deal with the situation, and our parasympatheticnervous system eases us back down to our baseline. However, when the\\nstress goes on and on, our body and brain become worn down.\\nThe cumulative effects of long-term stress include impaired function of\\nthe immune system, digestive and cardiac problems, and psychological\\nillness. In addition to the long-term effects of chronic stress, it’s simply not\\nenjoyable to live in a constant state of high alert.\\nThe first step in managing stress is awareness. Start simply by becoming\\ncurious about how you respond to stress, allowing the mind to open to what\\nyou’re experiencing. For example:\\n•Are you clenching your jaw?\\n•Is your stomach tight?\\n•Are you holding tension in your neck and shoulders?\\n•What is the quality of your breath like?\\n•What are your thoughts up to?\\nWith practice, we can sharpen our recognition of what stress feels like\\nin our bodies and minds, so that we can begin to let it go. Practicing\\nmindfulness (see chapter 6) can help in this regard.\\nEffective ways of managing the stress in our lives include:\\n•Minimizing unnecessary stress (e.g., steering clear of people who create\\nstress)\\n•Saying “no” to commitments when we’re already overextended\\n•Relaxing rigid and unrealistic standards for ourselves (e.g., I have to\\nfinish this project today)\\n•Focusing on what’s happening right in the present\\n•Taking slow breaths\\n•Practicing meditation\\n•Taking a yoga class\\n•Getting regular exercise\\n•Doing progressive muscle relaxation\\n•Taking short breaks throughout the day•Going on vacation\\n•Protecting time away from work each day and on the weekend\\n•Challenging unhelpful thoughts about what you should be doing\\n•Carving out time for yourself to do relaxing activities you enjoy like\\nreading or taking a warm bath\\nProgressive Muscle Relaxation\\nFollow these steps to reach a deep state of relaxation.\\n1Find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed. Silence your phone.\\n2Sit in a chair with your legs stretched out in front of you, heels on the\\nfloor. Make any necessary adjustments to get comfortable. Allow your\\neyes to close.\\n3Alternately tense and then relax the major muscle groups in your body,\\nstarting with your feet and working your way up. Create a moderate\\ndegree of muscular tension in each area of the body for a few seconds.\\nThen release the tension all at once, really noticing the contrast as you\\nmove from tense to relaxed. Continue to relax for 30 to 60 seconds\\nbefore tensing the next group of muscles.\\nThe sequence can include:\\nLower legs: One leg at a time, pull your toes toward you to create\\ntension along your shin.\\nThighs: One leg at a time, flex your leg, tensing the quadriceps muscle\\nin the front of your thigh.\\nGlutes: Squeeze your buttock muscles.\\nAbdomen: Tense your stomach muscles and pull your navel in toward\\nyour spine.\\nBreath: Take a deep breath in, allowing it to expand your chest, and\\nhold it. Release tension when you exhale.Upper arms: One arm at a time, tense the muscles in each upper arm.\\nForearms and hands: One arm at a time, make a fist and pull your hand\\nbackward toward your elbow, creating tension through your hand, wrist,\\nand forearm.\\nNeck and upper back: Shrug your shoulders up toward your ears.\\nFace and scalp: Raise your eyebrows while simultaneously scrunching\\nyour eyes tightly closed (you may need to remove contact lenses for this\\none).\\n4Take a few nice, slow breaths as you release any remaining muscle\\ntension, letting your entire body enter a state of deep relaxation.\\n5Bring your attention to your breath. Follow the sensations of breathing\\nin and out. With each exhalation, mentally say to yourself a single word\\nthat you associate with relaxation (e.g., “peace,” “calm,” “breathe,”\\netc.). Continue saying this word in your mind each time you exhale, for\\nthree to five minutes.\\n6Slowly return your awareness to where you are. Begin to wiggle your\\ntoes and fingers. When you’re ready, open your eyes. Notice how you\\nfeel.\\n7Practice this sequence at least once per day (ideally twice).\\n8Over time you can abbreviate the practice as you get more adept at\\nletting go of tension. You can do both legs or both arms at once, for\\nexample, and only do the muscle groups where you tend to hold tension.\\nBy pairing deep relaxation with a word and an exhale, you’ll be training\\nyour mind and body to enter a state of relaxation on cue. When you find\\nyourself starting to feel tense and stressed, you can take a calming breath,\\nsay your word as you exhale, and feel the benefits of all your progressive\\nmuscle relaxation training.\\nIn a world that puts a premium on constant busyness, it can feel like we\\ncan’t afford to take time to relax. However, this time is never wasted and\\nshould not be considered a luxury. By investing in your own well-being,\\nyou’ll be more productive and more enjoyable to be around.Engage with the Real World\\nIn the last decade, technology has permeated all areas of our lives. You may\\nremember a time, like I do, when there were no smart-phones or even cell\\nphones, no laptop computers, no social media or e-mail. The advent of these\\ntechnologies has brought many benefits, like rapid sharing of ideas and the\\nability to connect quickly and effortlessly with people around the globe.\\nAt the same time, there are potential downsides to the ubiquity of\\ntechnology. Many research studies have begun to examine the effects of\\nvarious technologies on our well-being. Their findings include:\\n•People who use Facebook more end up less happy over time, and less\\nsatisfied with their lives.\\n•Seeing others as happier or more successful in their social media posts\\nleads people to experience decreases in self-esteem and increases in\\nanxiety and jealousy.\\n•Greater smartphone use at home is associated with greater work–home\\nconflict.\\n•More time spent on technology is linked with greater burnout.\\n•A greater presence of technology in the bedroom is associated with\\nworse sleep.\\nTechnology can be highly addicting, so it’s easy to fall into patterns of\\noveruse. If you’ve been with a loved one who is constantly on their phone,\\nyou know firsthand the potential toll that technological intrusions can take\\non relationships. And yet, even as we find others’ constant use irritating, we\\nmay engage in the same behaviors ourselves.\\nTake a few moments to think about your own relationship with your\\nphone and other screens, and notice over the next few days how often\\nyou’re turning to your phone or tablet. While a whole world might await us\\non our smartphones, in another sense the scene never changes if we’re\\nglued to a screen. Consider whether it may be a good idea to increase the\\ntime you spend immersed in real life—for example:•Turn on your “Do Not Disturb” function when you want a break from\\nyour phone.\\n•Leave your phone at home sometimes.\\n•Turn off notifications so your phone isn’t prompting you to interact with\\nit.\\n•Make mealtime a technology-free zone.\\n•Make social media less easily available (e.g., uninstall it from your\\nsmartphone).\\n•Minimize the number of apps you use, since each one increases the\\nreasons you’ll find to be on your phone.\\n•Trade your smartphone for a traditional cell phone. While I know this\\noption sounds extreme, I found it liberating when I did it for three years.\\nSpend Time Outside\\nBeing outdoors is good for our well-being. For example, living in “greener”\\nneighborhoods is associated with better mental health. A study by Ian\\nAlcock and his collaborators found that those who moved to a greener area\\nhad a subsequent improvement in their mental health that was maintained\\nthrough a three-year follow-up period. Part of the beneficial effect of\\ngreener neighborhoods seems to come from the greater ability to walk for\\nrecreation; green areas like parks also serve as a meeting place for\\nneighborhood friends, facilitating social connection.\\nThere also appears to be a direct benefit of being in natural\\nenvironments that weren’t constructed by humans; for example, we can\\nenjoy the natural beauty of our surroundings while hiking in the woods,\\nperhaps even finding a sense of spiritual connection. Time in nature also\\ngives us a break from dealing with traffic, constant bombardment by\\nadvertising and entertainment, and automatic vigilance for potentially\\nthreatening people.\\n“Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength\\nthat will endure as long as life lasts. There is something infinitely healing inthe repeated refrains of nature—the assurance that dawn comes after night,\\nand spring after winter.”\\n—Rachel Carson\\nThere is also evidence from laboratory studies that viewing nature\\nscenes engages the parasympathetic nervous system, helping a person\\nrecover after encountering a stressor. Related findings showed that going\\nfor a walk in a natural environment (a grassland with scattered trees near\\nthe university where the study was conducted) compared to a walk in an\\nurban area led to decreased rumination, as well as decreased activity in a\\nregion of the brain linked to rumination.\\nIn short, there are ample reasons to spend time outdoors in natural\\nsettings. Where might you plan to spend more time to experience the\\nsatisfaction and stress relief that nature offers?\\nServe Others\\nSelf-care is anything but a selfish endeavor. The better we feel, the more we\\ncan give to others. The reverse also holds true: the more we do for others,\\nthe better we feel. Indeed, research has shown that making a point to help\\nothers leads to improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms.\\nWhy is helping others actually self-serving? Researchers in this area\\nhave suggested several possible explanations:\\n1Focusing on others can distract us from our own distress.\\n2Helping others provides a sense of meaning and purpose.\\n3Prosocial behaviors may cause the release of oxytocin, which is\\ninvolved in trust and bonding with others.\\n4There is something inherently rewarding about doing nice things for\\nothers, which may stimulate the release of dopamine.\\n5Reaching out to others may lower activity in our stress response system.\\nThere are many ways we can serve others:\\n•Showing support when someone we care about is struggling•Responding with compassion when someone makes a mistake\\n•Taking a friend to lunch\\n•Making our partner’s day a little easier\\n•Being gracious to other drivers\\n•Listening mindfully to another person\\n•Using our words to build others up\\n•Volunteering our time to help people in less-fortunate circumstances\\n•Going out of our way to help someone who can probably never repay\\nthe favor\\n•Donating material items we don’t need to people who could use them\\n•Helping a neighbor with yard work\\n•Preparing a meal for someone in need\\n•Donating money to a charity whose work we find meaningful\\n•Visiting someone we know who’s in the hospital\\nHelping others not only makes us happier, but also is contagious. Our\\nhelpful behaviors can multiply as others respond in kind.\\nWhat opportunities can you seize this week to brighten someone’s day—\\nand your own in the process? You might even start right now.\\nGive Thanks\\nOur minds are good at focusing on what’s wrong in our lives, to the\\nexclusion of what is going well. And yet when we can notice and appreciate\\nthe good in our lives, we often find that more joy is available to us than we\\nmight have thought.\\nGratitude has been linked with a wide range of positive outcomes,\\nincluding better mood, lower risk for depression, less stress, greater life\\nsatisfaction, and stronger relationships. These effects can be seen even with\\nsimple, short-term gratitude practices.\\nFor example, a team of researchers asked participants to write down\\neither things they were thankful for or some recent hassles in their lives; thegratitude exercise led to greater positive emotion, a more positive view of\\none’s life, and greater optimism about the future.\\nGratitude also makes us more likely to help others, even at a cost to\\nourselves; when we realize our own coffers are full, we’re more willing to\\nshare with others.\\nOur attentional systems are most sensitive to changes, and the things we\\nhave all the time become lost in the backdrop of our life. When we decide\\nto practice gratitude, we’re often surprised by how much we have to be\\nthankful for. These things likely include:\\n•A bed of your own every night\\n•People in your life who care about you\\n•Clothes that cover your body\\n•A planet teeming with life\\n•A star to warm your planet and enable photosynthesis\\n•Food to nourish your body and fuel your efforts\\n•Electricity, running water, and climate control\\n•Transportation\\n•A relatively safe neighborhood\\n•Lungs that deliver oxygen to every cell in your body and get rid of\\ncarbon dioxide\\n•A brain that brings you all of your experiences\\n•A heart to pump your blood\\n•Your five senses\\nAnd the list goes on: things we often don’t notice and appreciate until\\nwe realize we could lose them. How many times have we realized how\\nwonderful it is simply to be healthy following a bout of illness? We can\\neven find things to be thankful for in the midst of difficulties. For example,\\nwe might be distressed to have to take a child to the emergency room in the\\nmiddle of the night, but can be grateful to have 24-hour access to medical\\ncare. A word of caution here—be careful about urging others to practicegratitude when they’re going through a hard time. It can easily feel\\ninvalidating or dismissive of the struggles they’re having.\\nThere are many ways to practice gratitude, such as:\\n•Writing down things you are grateful for each day (doing this activity\\nbefore bed can even improve sleep)\\n•Spending a few minutes recalling things you are thankful for\\n•Verbalizing your gratitude to a person in your life\\n•Delivering a letter to someone in which you express your gratitude to\\nthem\\n•Practicing gratitude meditation\\nRecent research suggests that expressing our gratitude to others is even\\nmore effective than simply reflecting on it—and may be most effective\\nwhen we’re feeling depressed. Take a few moments now to think about\\nwhat you’re grateful for in your life.\\nChapter Summary and Homework\\nWe have with us at all times a potential friend—someone who can speak to\\nus encouragingly, praise our successes, support us when we’re down, plan\\nnice experiences for us, give us opportunities to use our strengths, and\\nchallenge us in a loving way. Unfortunately, we often play the role of our\\nown enemy, being quick to criticize and slow to forgive ourselves, keeping\\nourselves from physical exercise, depriving ourselves of sleep, feeding\\nourselves unhealthy food, and minimizing our enjoyment in life.\\nThrough the practices we covered in this chapter, you’ll be working on a\\ncompletely different approach: planning your life the way you would for\\nsomeone you love. These plans will take care of your fundamental needs for\\nnourishing food, restful sleep, and consistent movement. They also include\\nmanaging the inevitable stressors you encounter and spending time in\\nnature; finally, some of the kindest things you can do for yourself are to\\npractice gratitude and give back to others.\\nThese practices work well together. For example, studies of the\\nMediterranean lifestyle have found benefits not only of the diet but also ofgreater engagement in social activities and more physical activity; one study\\nfound that the Mediterranean diet alone led to about a 20 percent reduction\\nin depression risk, whereas adding greater physical activity and more\\nsocializing led to a 50 percent reduction.\\nReady to put your plans into action? You can start with these steps;\\nfocus initially on the ones that are most important to you:\\n1Take stock of whether you treat yourself like someone you care about.\\nIn what ways would you like to treat yourself better?\\n2Plan and start a consistent routine that prioritizes your sleep.\\n3Make one positive change in your nutrition plan—for example,\\npreparing a certain number of meals at home each week.\\n4Add more movement into your day. Start slowly and build gradually.\\n5Create a stress-management plan; include one small daily activity (e.g.,\\nlistening to relaxing music on the way home), one bigger weekly\\nactivity (e.g., taking a yoga class), and one monthly activity (e.g.,\\ngetting a professional massage).\\n6Incorporate more time in nature into your week: combine time outside\\nwith social contact if possible.\\n7Look for small ways to serve others every day, as well as bigger service\\nprojects to do on a regular basis (e.g., volunteering weekly at a food\\nbank).\\n8Write down three things you’re grateful for every evening before you go\\nto bed.Conclusion: Keeping It Going\\nThis book has presented ways to manage difficult emotions. We began with\\nthe principles of CBT and how it can be effective. We then covered the\\nthree pillars of CBT—behavioral, cognitive, and mindfulness-based\\ntechniques—and saw how these approaches can help with depression,\\nanger, anxiety, and other emotional experiences that can overwhelm us. The\\nprevious chapter focused on being friends with ourselves, which in fact is\\nthe overarching message of CBT.\\nI invite you to think back to what prompted you to pick up this book.\\nWhat was happening that told you it was time for a change? Review the\\ninitial goals you set during your work in chapter 2.\\nI hope the strategies I’ve offered in these chapters have helped you\\nmove toward achieving your goals. As you revisit the goals you set, what\\nbenefits have you found from the work you’ve done? You might talk with a\\nloved one to see what they have noticed as you’ve applied the techniques\\nfrom this book.\\nZach thought back to how depressed he had been six months ago. He\\nrecalled how little energy and motivation he had at that time, and how\\nirritable he’d been. He’d even started to question if he should go on\\nliving, which had startled him. From that point, he’d worked hard to\\nreclaim his life and now stood in a very different place.\\nAs Zach talked over these changes with his wife, Lisa, they thought\\ntogether about what had made the biggest difference. “You definitely\\nseemed happier once you started seeing friends again,” Lisa said. Zach\\nrecalled how hard it’d been initially to get himself to reach out to\\nfriends and ultimately how uplifting it had been.\\n“I know exercise made a big difference, too,” he said. He paused and\\nthen added, “I think the biggest thing was just remembering that I’m an\\nokay person, and that people actually like me. I’d started believing\\nreally nasty things about myself.”As they continued their discussion, Zach wrote down the keys to his\\nrecovery that he wanted to remember.\\nLearning what helps you is one of the most important things you can\\ndiscover. I strongly advise you to write down the behaviors and mind-set\\nyou need to return to in order to be at your best.\\nWith repetition, many of these new practices will become second\\nnature. For example, we may begin to associate certain mornings of the\\nweek with yoga or running. However, other strategies may be easier to let\\nslide, especially those that are hard to plan specific times for—things like\\npracticing gratitude, being present in our everyday activities, and\\nchallenging our thoughts.\\nAdditionally, some of the challenges we face make us less likely to use\\nthe strategies that are helpful to us. For example, the hopelessness of\\ndepression might start to tell us there’s “no point” in doing the very things\\nthat would make us feel better. Having a written plan makes it easier to\\nremember the tools we need.\\nZach tended to think visually, so he created an integrated plan that\\nlooked like this:\\nZach saw healthy thinking as central to feeling well and recognized how\\nhis thoughts influenced his willingness to do other things thatcontributed to his recovery. These activities in turn reinforced his\\nhealthy thought patterns. He found that mindfulness had enriched each\\nof these practices, and so framed all of them in the context of mindful\\npresence.\\nAs you summarize the strategies you found useful, think about how they\\nrelate to each other. Notice any “virtuous circles” you’ve created, in which\\npositive changes are mutually reinforcing. For example, exercise can make\\nit easier to eat well, which in turn improves your energy, making it easier to\\nexercise.\\nThere’s no wrong format for your written plan. It just should include the\\nkey reminders you’ll need, organized in a way that will make sense to you\\nwhen you come back to it.\\nI also hope this book will be a resource you return to as needed. I\\nencourage you to take notes, highlight passages, and bookmark the pages\\nyou’ll want to review.\\nEven more important is the personal learning you’ve acquired about\\nwhat works best for you—I expect this will be your best resource. I hope\\nyou’re feeling more confident that you can manage any difficulties you\\nface. That knowledge alone can greatly decrease our distress.\\nAlong with a written record of what works for you, I suggest you have\\nan easy-to-remember phrase or slogan that captures the tools available to\\nyou. I like “Think, Act, Be,” since it represents the main strategies in CBT.\\nYou might use that one or come up with your own to remind you of what’s\\nhelped in the past.\\nWhat to Do If You’re Still Struggling\\nIf you haven’t made the progress toward your goals that you were hoping\\nfor, you have several options.\\n•Consider if you’re on the right track—having made some progress\\n—and simply have more work to do. If that’s the case, continue the\\nthings that have helped so far, and consider adding other strategies. It\\ntakes time and practice to get to a significantly better place.•Alternatively, it may be that this book was not the best fit for you.\\nMaybe your concerns were driven primarily by conflict in your marriage\\nthat requires couples therapy, or perhaps you need additional guidance\\nfrom working directly with a therapist. Whatever the case may be, I\\nencourage you to keep seeking the help you need. I’ve included\\nresources in the back of this book for finding a therapist near you, as\\nwell as websites and additional books that may be helpful.\\n•If at any point you find that your struggles are getting worse, not\\nbetter, seek professional help right away. You can ask for a mental\\nhealth referral from your primary care doctor. I’ve also provided online\\nlinks for finding help in the Resources section. If you think you could be\\na danger to yourself or someone else, go to the nearest emergency room\\nor call 911.\\nWhere to Go from Here?\\nIf you’re happy with the progress you’ve made, what’s next? First, I\\nencourage you to feel good about what you’ve accomplished. It takes\\ncourage and determination to persevere when life is hard, and it’s no small\\nthing to learn new skills for better living.\\nIf you feel like you’ve made considerable progress toward your goals, I\\nurge you not to limit yourself. When the worst of our difficulties is behind\\nus, we’re in a better position to ask ourselves what thriving would look like.\\nWhat new goals might you set for yourself? Maybe you've been\\ncontemplating a professional move or want to make your home life better\\nthan it's ever been.\\nEven as you accept yourself exactly as you are, remember that growth is\\nan ongoing process, and we can continue to raise the ceiling on our\\nexperience. Why be content with just getting by? You can use right\\nthinking, right action, and mindful awareness not just for repairing things\\nthat are broken but for building a life you love.\\nSTAYING WELLIt’s natural when we’re feeling better to stop investing as much in our well-\\nbeing. I strongly recommend that you resist this tendency and keep doing\\nthe things that helped you. Now is a good time to take stock of what will be\\nimportant to keep doing. I also suggest you think ahead to potential pitfalls\\nyou’ll want to avoid. In the spirit of CBT, we can plan in advance for\\ncircumstances that will challenge us.\\nZach knew the coming winter months not only offered fewer hours of\\ndaylight, but also made him less inclined to exercise and socialize. As\\nthe fall days grew shorter, he began to put plans in place to get him\\nthrough the winter, like joining an indoor pool and scheduling time with\\nfriends.\\nHe also talked with Lisa about his intentions for the winter so she could\\nsupport his efforts and so he would have some accountability. Knowing\\nhe had a plan also lessened his worry about the winter months.\\nWhat situations in your own life could lead to a setback without\\nadequate preparation? Take some time to write down a plan for how you\\nwill handle them.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nI’d like to leave you with a few key points to keep in mind.\\nFirst, remember that you’re worth taking care of. Our society, for the\\nmost part, treats self-care as a self-indulgent luxury, when in fact it is not\\nonly essential for your well-being, but also benefits the people in your life.\\nAlong those lines, I hope you surround yourself with people who care\\nabout you and bring out the best in you, and that you nurture your closest\\nconnections. Few things have as big an impact on our well-being as the\\nquality of our relationships; strong ones will sustain you through anything\\nthat comes your way.\\nNo matter what you’re going through, make every effort to serve others.\\nJust as self-care isn’t selfish, service to others is not really self-sacrifice,\\nand helps us the most when we’re struggling.And finally, remember to practice gratitude as often as possible, which\\nis one of the kindest things you can do for yourself. Remind yourself of all\\nyou have, even when things are far from perfect. Gratitude doesn’t deny our\\nproblems, but it does lighten their weight.\\nIn the spirit of gratitude, I am thankful that you took the time to read\\nthis book. Keep working. Keep using your mind, your actions, and your\\npresence to be the person you want to be. I wish you the very best as you\\ncontinue your journey.Resources\\nOnline Resources\\nVisit the following online resources to enhance your learning, to find\\nprofessional help, and to dive deeper into treatments and techniques.\\nGENERAL INFORMA TION\\nANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA\\n(ADAA)\\nhttp://www .adaa.or g/understanding-anxiety\\nThe ADAA website discusses what distinguishes normal anxiety and\\ndepression from a disorder, provides statistics about these conditions, and\\nhas information about OCD and PTSD.\\nMAYO CLINIC HEALTHY LIFESTYLE\\nwww .mayoclinic.or g/healthy-lifestyle\\nThe Mayo Clinic offers overviews on healthy eating, fitness, stress\\nmanagement, weight loss, and other topics.

It wasn’t until I’d been out of the house for a\\ncouple decades that I understood what it takes to be a loving and involved\\nparent while dealing with the best and hardest parts of life. I also thank my\\nbrothers, Yonder, Malachi, Tim, and Charlie—life would not be the same\\nwithout the bond we share.\\nI started my clinical training at The George Washington University and\\nwas lucky to have Dr. Raymond Pasi teach my first course. I’ve continued\\nto benefit from his wisdom and humor over the past 17 years. Professor\\nRich Lanthier introduced me to the field of human development and was\\ninstrumental in guiding my own development in graduate school.\\nI was drawn to the University of Pennsylvania for my doctorate because\\nof its strong reputation for CBT training and had an even better experience\\nthan I’d hoped for thanks to the talented faculty. Dr. Dianne Chambless, a\\nleader in evidence-based psychological treatments, enriched my experience\\nthrough her role as Director of Clinical Training. Dr. Melissa Hunt taught\\nme skills in evidence-based assessment that I continue to rely on. Dr. Alan\\nGoldstein, my first therapy supervisor, proved that CBT can be as warm as\\nit is effective. I enjoyed Dr. Rob DeRubeis’s cognitive therapy supervision\\nso much that I completed his practicum three times, and I strive to reflect\\nhis approach in my own role as supervisor. My brilliant thesis advisor Dr.\\nMartha Farah made my graduate experience a rich one; I continue to benefit\\nfrom her kindness and guidance.\\nThanks also to Dr. Zindel Segal, pioneer of mindfulness-based cognitive\\ntherapy, for a stimulating introduction to mindfulness in a clinical context\\ntoward the end of my graduate training.\\nDr. Elyssa Kushner helped me build on that introduction when I was in\\nmy first faculty position; her instruction in mindfulness-based treatment for\\nanxiety provided an invaluable “third wave” in my own development as atherapist. I learned from Dr. Edna Foa not only the nuances of powerful\\nexposure treatments, but also how to make each word count as a writer; her\\npassion for dissemination is reflected in my work after leaving full-time\\nacademia.\\nSince that time, I’ve been most fortunate to connect with a strong and\\ntalented group of clinicians in the community, including my frequent\\ncollaborators Drs. Rick Summers, David Steinman, Donald Tavakoli, Pace\\nDuckett, Matt Kayser, Dhwani Shah, Catherine Riley, Teresa Saris, and\\nMadeleine Weiser (who also provides stellar pediatric care to our kids),\\nalong with others too numerous to list here.\\nI’m grateful for the support and collegiality of my friends and fellow\\npsychologists Drs.
